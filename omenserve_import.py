"""Reading an operator's accumulated history out of an OmenServe install.

The single biggest barrier to trying DCCore is not features - it is abandoning
years of totals. That barrier turns out to be three numbers wide.

WHERE THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY LIVE

Not in an OmenServe file. OmenServe keeps nothing of its own: the counters are
mIRC's persistent %variables, in `scripts/vars.ini`, written by whichever
add-ons the operator runs. Mapped from a live install (#69):

    %SD*, %OS.*   OmenServe core        the speed record, list counts
    %OSL.*        the OS-Limits add-on  per-day file counts
    %mx.*         mxrarserver           files and bytes sent

That is the important caveat and the reason nothing here is required: the
totals come from ADD-ONS, not from OmenServe itself. Two operators running
different ones keep their history in different variables, and one running
neither has none to import. A variable that is not there produces an absent
field, never a zero - writing a zero over a real total would be the worst
thing this feature could do.

vars.ini's format is one numbered key per variable, name and value sharing the
value: `n7=%mx.rarsent 45902`.

WHY THE PARSING IS HERE AND NOT IN THE BROWSER

The dashboard reads the file in the page and sends only the lines whose
variable is named below, so an operator's other ~268 variables - their nicks,
channels, paths and add-on settings - never cross the network. That part has
to be in JavaScript, because that is where the file is.

The parsing does not. This repository never executes JavaScript in a test:
tests/test_web_assets.py checks that app.js *parses*, explicitly "not what the
script does", there is no node in CI, and none of the web tests run any of it.
A parser handling hand-edited text, whose output is written to cumulative
totals with no undo, is the last thing that should live where it cannot be
tested. So the page filters and this parses.

Nothing here imports anything from this repository, deliberately: webserver.py
may only pull in six modules (tests/test_import_graph.py) and this is not one
of them, so its handler imports this lazily, the way it already does `list`.
