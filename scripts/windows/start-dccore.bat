rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------
rem  DCCore launcher for Windows.
rem
rem  The important line is the cd below. Every data path in config.py is
rem  relative - ./data/bans.txt, ./lists - so they resolve against the
rem  working directory. Double-clicking this file from anywhere, or
rem  running it from a shortcut, would otherwise start the daemon with a
rem  working directory that is not the repository, and it would quietly
rem  create an empty data folder somewhere else and boot with no bans,
rem  no queue and no list.
rem
rem  Usage:
rem    scripts\windows\start-dccore.bat          first run: ask the setup questions;
rem                                              then check the setup and start the daemon
rem    scripts\windows\start-dccore.bat check    check the setup and stop
rem
rem  THE LAUNCHER IS THE INSTALL (#547, Proposal 1). A first-timer's whole
rem  install is: extract, double-click this file. With no config yet it
rem  runs configure.py right here rather than telling them to copy a
rem  sample; before every start it offers to install Flask if the
rem  dashboard is on and Flask is missing; and it finds Python where the
rem  python.org installer puts it even when the "Add to PATH" box was
rem  missed. Nothing an already-configured install does changes.
rem
rem  PYTHON MISSING: HELP, DO NOT FAIL (#547, Proposal 2). When there is no
rem  Python at all, the one wall left, this file offers to fetch python.org's
rem  own installer, checks it against the SHA-256 pinned below, and runs it
rem  unattended with both boxes ticked - per user, so no administrator
rem  prompt. It asks first, and a hash that does not match refuses to run
rem  the file, loudly. Moving to a newer Python is three lines here: the
rem  version and the two hashes, copied from the release page on python.org.

rem --- check-only mode ---------------------------------------------------
rem  NOT written as `if ... ( ... exit /b %errorlevel% )`. cmd.exe expands
rem  %errorlevel% when it PARSES the parenthesised block, before anything
rem  inside it has run, so the value used is whatever it was beforehand -
rem  0 - whatever check-setup.py actually returned. Verified on Windows 11:
rem  the block form exits 0 where this form exits the real code.
rem
rem  It matters because `start-dccore.bat check` is the documented Windows
rem  pre-flight in README.md, docs/INSTALL.md and docs/WINDOWS.md. It would
rem  print "FAIL ..." and "1 problem(s) - fix these before starting", then
rem  exit 0 - so a wrapper, a scheduled task or a CI step gating on the
rem  exit code treated a broken config as verified.

rem  block), so the two launchers had drifted on the one thing this shim
rem  layer exists to keep identical.

rem --- refuse to start without a local config ---------------------------

rem  note) - the daemon starts fine from it alone, so this only refuses
rem  when NEITHER override exists.
rem  An upgrading install has neither, but is NOT unconfigured: #170 renamed
rem  local_config.py to admin_config.py, and that file is gitignored, so the
rem  pull renamed defaults.py for them and could not touch theirs. The daemon
rem  renames it at import time - but this check runs first, so without this
rem  branch the operator is told to copy the sample, and doing so is exactly
rem  the condition that makes the migration skip for good.

rem  music folder, dashboard, password - and writes settings.conf and
rem  admin_config.py; it used to be a separate terminal step this file then
rem  told people to go and do. A tree without configure.py (a broken
rem  extract) still gets the old instruction, so nothing is worse than before.
