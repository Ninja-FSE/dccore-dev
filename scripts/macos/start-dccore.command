# DCCore launcher for macOS.
#
# A .command file is what Finder runs in Terminal on a double-click, which
# is the whole reason this exists: the Linux launcher already does
# everything right on macOS (it is portable sh and probes for the Xcode
# python3 stub), but a first-timer will not open Terminal to run it.
#
# Gatekeeper will refuse a .command downloaded from the internet the first
# time: right-click it, choose Open, and confirm once. After that a
# double-click works. README-FIRST.txt says the same.
#
# Usage:
#   double-click                 first run: ask the setup questions;
#                                then check the setup and start the daemon
#   ./start-dccore.command check check the setup and stop
