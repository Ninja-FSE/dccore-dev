# DCCore launcher for Linux.
#
# The important line is the cd below. Every data path in config.py is
# relative - ./data/bans.txt, ./lists - so they resolve against the
# working directory. Running this from a cron job, a systemd unit with
# no WorkingDirectory set, or a symlink on PATH would otherwise start
# the daemon with a working directory that is not the repository, and
# it would quietly create an empty data folder somewhere else and boot
# with no bans, no queue and no list.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh          first run: ask the setup questions;
#                                            then check the setup and start the daemon
#   ./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh check    check the setup and stop
#
# THE LAUNCHER IS THE INSTALL (#547, Proposal 1). With no config yet it runs
# configure.py right here rather than telling the operator to copy a sample,
# and before every start it offers to install Flask if the dashboard is on
# and Flask is missing. Nothing an already-configured install does changes.
#
# Also the macOS launcher: scripts/macos/start-dccore.command is a one-line
# wrapper that runs this file, so it must stay portable sh - no bashisms, and
# no `readlink -f`, which macOS did not have before 12.3.
