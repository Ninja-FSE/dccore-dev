"""Where every setting sits in dccore.mrc's settings window (#1264).

PURE DATA. scripts/mirc/build_settings_window.py reads this file, takes the
labels, units, choices, types and help texts from the bot's own metadata
(webserver.SETTINGS_LABELS and friends), lays the controls out and writes the
dialog into a marked block of dccore.mrc. Nothing here is mIRC code and
nothing here is a position: move a setting by moving its line.

The grouping is the settings-window mockup's: six tabs, a column of page
buttons on the left of each, sections inside a page, in the mockup's order. It is NOT the
dashboard's SETTINGS_CATEGORIES order on purpose - the mockup moved the
switches used most onto General Settings, so SEARCH_ENABLED is there and not
on Search.

An item is one of:

    "KEY"                                  a setting, with its dashboard label
    {"key": "KEY", "label": "..."}         the same, with the mockup's shorter label
    {"local": "option", "label": "..."}    one of this mIRC's own switches (dccore.ini)
    {"note": "..."}                        a line or two of explanation
    {"widget": "name", "keys": [...]}      a structured control the script drives
                                           by hand; `keys` are the settings it edits

THE PLACEMENT RULE. Every key in webserver.SETTINGS_CATEGORIES is placed
exactly once - as an item or in a widget's `keys` - or listed in EXCLUDED with
the reason it is not in the window. tests/test_the_mirc_settings_window.py
fails on a key that is in neither, so a setting added to the bot cannot
silently miss the window.

Examples in notes are invented (#music, host.example): this file ships.
