;  dccore.mrc - the bot's whole life in one mIRC window
; =====================================================================
;
;  What it does
;    Opens the admin DCC chat to your DCCore bot, logs in by itself, and
;    draws everything the bot reports in one custom window, @DCCore:
;    the feed (requests, queue, sends, failures, searches, bans, joins)
;    coloured per kind, a side panel with what is sending and who is
;    waiting, and a title bar with the slots, the queue and today's
;    totals. Anything you type in the window goes back to the bot as a
;    console command, and the reply comes back into the window.
;
;    And @DCCore-Downloads (#1022): what the bot is downloading from other
;    bots, what waits, and what finished - see its section below.
;
;    And a settings window (#1264): the bot's settings, as its dashboard's
;    Settings page has them - /dccore settings, or Settings... in the menus.
;
;    And DCCore Chat (#371): a second window for public chat with other
;    operators in the channels your bot is in, relayed by the bot - see
;    its section near the end of this file.
;
;    When mIRC starts, @DCCore opens by itself, minimised, and says what it
;    is waiting for until the console connects; Chat and Downloads can do
;    the same - "Open when mIRC starts" in /dccore options (#1201).
;
;  Install
;    Save this file anywhere (your mIRC folder is fine), then in mIRC:
;
;        /load -rs dccore.mrc
;        /dccore pair MusicBot         (MusicBot = your bot's nick)
;
;    The window opens and the bot asks for the password: type it in the
;    window ONCE. The script then asks the bot for a login token of its
;    own, keeps it in dccore.ini next to this file, and from then on
;    connects and logs in without you. The token opens the console and
;    nothing else - it cannot open the web dashboard - and
;    /dccore unpair revokes it at any time.
;
;    dccore.ini is CLEAR TEXT (#683): mIRC's hash-table save writes the
;    token readable, beside this file. Treat that file as you would a
;    password file - it is what a copied mIRC folder or a shared PC
;    gives away, not the .mrc - and /dccore unpair the moment you think
;    it has travelled: the bot then refuses that token for good.
;
;    Then:   /dccore              the command list
;            /dccore options      what to show, in which colour
;            /dccore settings     the bot's own settings (#1264)
;
;  Requirements
;    mIRC 6.10 or later. Everything used here dates from mIRC 6.x or
;    earlier: custom windows with an editbox and a side listbox
;    (/window -el), /aline -l, /titlebar, on CHAT with ^ to halt the
;    default text, on CHATCLOSE, hash tables with /hsave and /hload,
;    /hinc and /hdel -w, /timer -m, dialog tables with combo, check and
;    edit, $round, $regex, $duration, $qt, $base, and for the window
;    background /background, /bset and /bwrite (a small .bmp of the
;    chosen colour: mIRC has no per-window background colour, only a
;    per-window picture). Nothing from
;    mIRC 7 (no $json, no UTF-8 switches): the wire is plain ASCII, the
;    bot has already turned control characters into spaces, and the only
;    characters above 127 this script draws are the middle dot and the
;    non-breaking space, which every Windows ANSI code page has.
;
;    A bot that answers `hello` - the DCCore this script ships with, or a
;    later one. An older bot answers "Unknown command" and the script drops to plain mode,
;    where the window simply shows the chat as it comes - still coloured
;    by the bot's own theme, still a console, just no panel.
;
;  The protocol is in docs/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md ("The structured feed, for a
;  script"). Ships with DCCore under the same licence.
;
;  Notes for anyone editing this
;    - Every alias is global (no -l): timers run outside the script's
;      scope and cannot reach a local alias. They are all namespaced
;      dccore.* so they collide with nothing.
;    - Text passed through $1- has its runs of spaces collapsed, so all
;      column padding is done with $chr(160), a non-breaking space.
;    - A ";" begins a comment only at the start of a line, and [ ] are
;      evaluation brackets, so a literal bracket is $chr(91)/$chr(93).
;    - Newer mIRC: the floor stays 6.10 for everything the window does.
;      Where a 7.x identifier adds something real, gate it with
;      if ($version >= 7) { } rather than raising the floor. mIRC 7
;      already decodes the chat as UTF-8, so non-ASCII file names show
;      correctly there without any change here.

;  the window says `downloads on <rows>` when it opens (and after a
;  reconnect) and `downloads off` when it closes. Searching other bots'
;  lists and adding to the queue stay on the dashboard; the menu opens it.

;  can be selected and right-clicked. dlmap.<line> remembers which download
;  a line is: "<kind>:<state>:<id>" (one word, so it passes as one argument). The bars are # and - (plain ASCII).

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;  Settings window (#1264): the bot's settings, as its dashboard has them
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;  /dccore settings, or Settings... in the menus. Six tabs along the top,
;  the pages of the chosen tab in a column of buttons on the left, Apply / OK / Cancel
;  at the bottom. Everything goes through the console (docs/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md,
;  "Settings over the console"), so the bot checks and saves a value
;  exactly as its dashboard's Settings page does, and says why it refused
;  one in the page's own words.
;
;  The dialog table and its lookup data are GENERATED: the block between
;  the BEGIN and END lines below is written by
;  scripts/mirc/build_settings_window.py from the bot's own settings
;  metadata and scripts/mirc/settings_window_layout.py. Change those, not
;  the block. What follows the block is written by hand: it opens, loads,
;  keeps track of what changed and saves.
;
;  The tabs are only a strip. No control is attached to one - mIRC would
;  show every control of a tab again whenever it is clicked - so a page's
;  controls are shown, and the page before hidden, by hand (did -v/-h).
;
;  dccore.swm   the generated lookup data (dccore.sw.data): k.<KEY> is
;               "<control> <kind> <unit factor> <label>", p.<page>.<n> the
;               page's control ids, h.<KEY> the help, i.<id> the setting a
;               control belongs to, ...
;  dccore.sws   this opening of the window: the values as loaded (v.<KEY>,
;               "=" and the value), what each control showed then (d.<KEY>),
;               the structured pages' rows, and where a transaction is
;               (phase: caps, load, idle, apply, confirm, aborting, preview).
;
;  Every snapshot the bot sends is counted against its BEGIN and END lines
;  before anything is shown from it: the bot's outbox drops lines for a
;  client that falls behind, and a page edited from half a snapshot would
;  save half a configuration.
;
;  It needs mIRC 6.17 or later, for $regsubex, which decodes the values.

;  (srv.c.<n> = "<list> <channel token> <mode>", srv.f.<n> = "<list>

  hadd dccore.swm pg.PORT 1
  hadd dccore.swm n.PORT Port
  hadd dccore.swm h.PORT The port on that server. 6667 is the normal one for plain IRC; the bot does not use SSL.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.NICKNAME 1
  hadd dccore.swm n.NICKNAME Nickname
  hadd dccore.swm h.NICKNAME The bot's name on IRC. People request files with it (for example @YourBot for the list)~2C so pick something short and easy to type. Required - the bot will not start without it.
  hadd dccore.swm k.ALT_NICKNAME 2013 str 1 2012
  hadd dccore.swm pg.ALT_NICKNAME 1
  hadd dccore.swm n.ALT_NICKNAME Alt nickname
  hadd dccore.swm h.ALT_NICKNAME A backup name used if the main one is already taken when the bot connects. If this one is taken too~2C a digit is added to it. The bot switches back to the main name as soon as it is free.
  hadd dccore.swm k.REJOIN_ATTEMPTS 2017 int 1 2016
  hadd dccore.swm pg.REJOIN_ATTEMPTS 1
  hadd dccore.swm n.REJOIN_ATTEMPTS Rejoin attempts after a kick (0 = never)
  hadd dccore.swm h.REJOIN_ATTEMPTS How many times the bot tries to get back into a channel after being kicked before giving up on it. It waits until the next advert is due before each try~2C so it never looks like it is fighting the kick. 0 means never rejoin.
  hadd dccore.swm k.ON_CONNECT_CHECK_MINUTES 2021 int 1 2020

  hadd dccore.swm n.ON_CONNECT_CHECK_MINUTES Check the on-connect commands worked every (minutes~2C 0 = never)
  hadd dccore.swm h.ON_CONNECT_CHECK_MINUTES How often the bot checks that its on-connect commands worked. If they set a user mode such as +x and the server has not given it - or~2C for +x~2C has not hidden the host - the bot sends all of them again. This is for a net split~2C when the X login can go nowhere.
  hadd dccore.swm k.SEARCH_ENABLED 2041 bool 1 2041
  hadd dccore.swm pg.SEARCH_ENABLED 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.SEARCH_ENABLED Answer @find searches
  hadd dccore.swm h.SEARCH_ENABLED Answer @find and @locator searches. Off~2C they are ignored without a reply and the channel advert says Search: OFF. Requests for files and lists are still answered.
  hadd dccore.swm k.ANNOUNCE_TRANSFERS 2045 bool 1 2045
  hadd dccore.swm pg.ANNOUNCE_TRANSFERS 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.ANNOUNCE_TRANSFERS Announce finished transfers in the channel
  hadd dccore.swm h.ANNOUNCE_TRANSFERS Post a line in the channel each time a file has been sent. Everything else about a transfer is private to the person who asked; this is the only public part. A file asked for by private message is never announced.
  hadd dccore.swm k.RAR_ENABLED 2049 bool 1 2049
  hadd dccore.swm pg.RAR_ENABLED 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.RAR_ENABLED Enable !rar folder packing
  hadd dccore.swm h.RAR_ENABLED Let people request a whole folder packed as one .rar file (with !rar). Turn off if you do not have the rar program or do not want the bot packing folders. Single-file downloads work either way.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.PRIVATE_MESSAGES_ENABLED 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.PRIVATE_MESSAGES_ENABLED Keep private messages (off: keep none~2C reply once instead)
  hadd dccore.swm h.PRIVATE_MESSAGES_ENABLED Keep private messages people send to the bot so you can read them on the Messages page. The bot does not answer them. Turn off to keep none and instead reply once telling the sender where to go.
  hadd dccore.swm k.WEBUI_ENABLED 2057 bool 1 2057
  hadd dccore.swm pg.WEBUI_ENABLED 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.WEBUI_ENABLED Enable web dashboard
  hadd dccore.swm h.WEBUI_ENABLED Turn the web dashboard on. Off by default so nothing opens a web page just because the bot was updated. Needs the Flask package installed.
  hadd dccore.swm k.CTCP_VERSION_REPLY 2061 bool 1 2061
  hadd dccore.swm pg.CTCP_VERSION_REPLY 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.CTCP_VERSION_REPLY Answer CTCP VERSION
  hadd dccore.swm h.CTCP_VERSION_REPLY Answer when somebody asks the bot what software it runs (a CTCP VERSION request). The answer goes only to the person who asked. Turn off to stay quiet about it.
  hadd dccore.swm k.CHECK_FOR_UPDATES 2065 bool 1 2065
  hadd dccore.swm pg.CHECK_FOR_UPDATES 2
  hadd dccore.swm n.CHECK_FOR_UPDATES Tell me when a new version is out
  hadd dccore.swm h.CHECK_FOR_UPDATES Once a day~2C ask GitHub whether a newer DCCore has been released~2C and say so on the dashboard~2C in the console and in the mIRC window. Only the version numbers are compared; nothing about your bot is sent. Turn it off on a machine that should not go out.
  hadd dccore.swm k.DEBUG_CHANNEL 2069 str 1 2068
  hadd dccore.swm pg.DEBUG_CHANNEL 3
  hadd dccore.swm n.DEBUG_CHANNEL Debug channel
  hadd dccore.swm h.DEBUG_CHANNEL A channel of your own where the bot reports what it is doing - transfers~2C joins~2C bans~2C problems. Leave blank for none. Do not use a channel other people sit in: everything the bot reports goes there.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.CHANNEL 3
  hadd dccore.swm n.CHANNEL Channels
  hadd dccore.swm h.CHANNEL The channel(s) the bot serves in~2C separated by commas. The first one is where announcements go unless a request came from another channel. Required.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.ADMIN_NICK 4
  hadd dccore.swm n.ADMIN_NICK Admin nick(s)
  hadd dccore.swm h.ADMIN_NICK Your own nick(s) - the people allowed to use the admin commands such as !ban~2C !rehash and !update. Separate several with commas. Required. If you have set ADMIN_HOSTMASKS~2C the command must also come from that host.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.CUSTOM_THEME_BORDER 5
  hadd dccore.swm n.CUSTOM_THEME_BORDER Border colour

  hadd dccore.swm pg.CUSTOM_THEME_SEPARATOR 5

  hadd dccore.swm n.ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL Advert interval (seconds)
  hadd dccore.swm h.ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL How often the bot posts its advert in the channel~2C in seconds. 300 is every five minutes. Do not go much lower - channels do not like a bot that advertises constantly.
  hadd dccore.swm k.BROADCAST_SEARCH_CHANNEL 2109 str 1 2108
  hadd dccore.swm pg.BROADCAST_SEARCH_CHANNEL 6
  hadd dccore.swm n.BROADCAST_SEARCH_CHANNEL Broadcast search channel

  hadd dccore.swm n.MSG_DELAY Message delay (seconds)
  hadd dccore.swm h.MSG_DELAY How many seconds the bot waits between the lines it sends to the server. Protects you from being disconnected for flooding. 5 is safe on Undernet; lower is faster but riskier.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.DEBUG_MSG_DELAY 6
  hadd dccore.swm n.DEBUG_MSG_DELAY Debug message delay (seconds)
  hadd dccore.swm h.DEBUG_MSG_DELAY How long to wait between lines to your debug channel. Never less than MSG_DELAY - every line the bot sends shares one clock~2C and a smaller number here has no effect. Set it higher than MSG_DELAY to slow the debug channel down further; 0 means the same as MSG_DELAY.
  hadd dccore.swm k.MAX_DCC_SLOTS 2125 int 1 2124

  hadd dccore.swm n.MAX_DCC_SLOTS Max simultaneous sends
  hadd dccore.swm h.MAX_DCC_SLOTS How many files the bot sends at the same time. Everyone else waits in the queue. 3 is a good number for a home connection; raise it only if your upload speed can take it.

  hadd dccore.swm n.MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS Max search results
  hadd dccore.swm h.MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS How many matching files are sent back to somebody who searches with @find. Each result is one line to that person.

  hadd dccore.swm n.SEARCH_SHOW_FOLDER Name the folder in search replies
  hadd dccore.swm h.SEARCH_SHOW_FOLDER In the reply to an @find~2C name each result's folder on a line of its own above its files~2C e.g. From: D:\MEDIA\Rock\Some Band\1999 - Some Album. One extra line per folder~2C not per file; the result lines stay exactly as they are. Off by default: every line is paced~2C so it slows the reply.
  hadd dccore.swm k.SEARCH_FOLDER_MAX_CHARS 2145 int 1 2144
  hadd dccore.swm pg.SEARCH_FOLDER_MAX_CHARS 7
  hadd dccore.swm n.SEARCH_FOLDER_MAX_CHARS Longest folder shown (characters)
  hadd dccore.swm h.SEARCH_FOLDER_MAX_CHARS The longest folder a From: line shows~2C in characters~2C so the line does not wrap. A longer one is cut from the left and starts with ...~2C keeping its end~2C where the album name is. At least 10.
  hadd dccore.swm k.PAUSE_ON_UPDATE 2149 bool 1 2149
  hadd dccore.swm pg.PAUSE_ON_UPDATE 7
  hadd dccore.swm n.PAUSE_ON_UPDATE Pause sharing during !update
  hadd dccore.swm h.PAUSE_ON_UPDATE While a rebuilt list is being swapped in - a few seconds at the end of !update - refuse searches and file requests. The rest of the rebuild~2C they are answered from the current list~2C which stays complete until the swap.
  hadd dccore.swm k.PAUSE_FOR_WHOLE_UPDATE 2153 bool 1 2153
  hadd dccore.swm pg.PAUSE_FOR_WHOLE_UPDATE 7
  hadd dccore.swm n.PAUSE_FOR_WHOLE_UPDATE Pause for the whole rebuild
  hadd dccore.swm h.PAUSE_FOR_WHOLE_UPDATE The old behaviour: refuse searches and file requests for the whole rebuild~2C not only while the new list is swapped in. Only needs Pause sharing during !update on too.
  hadd dccore.swm k.REHASH_TRANSFER_WAIT 2157 int 1 2156
  hadd dccore.swm pg.REHASH_TRANSFER_WAIT 7
  hadd dccore.swm n.REHASH_TRANSFER_WAIT Seconds a rehash waits for transfers to finish
  hadd dccore.swm h.REHASH_TRANSFER_WAIT When you rehash (reload settings)~2C how many seconds the bot waits for running transfers to finish first before reloading anyway. 0 reloads straight away.

  hadd dccore.swm cl.DCC_BLOCK_SIZE.7 256 KB
  hadd dccore.swm h.DCC_BLOCK_SIZE How much the bot sends at once~2C in bytes. The default~2C 64 KB~2C suits most bots. 128 or 256 KB use less CPU and suit a fast seedbox~2C but Speed now and the advert's Speed: then move a block at a time~2C so slow sends read 0 or jump~2C and a stalled receiver is dropped after a minute per 64 KB.
  hadd dccore.swm k.DCC_SEND_BUFFER 2165 int 1024 2164

  hadd dccore.swm n.DCC_SEND_BUFFER Socket send buffer (0 = the default for your platform) (KB)
  hadd dccore.swm h.DCC_SEND_BUFFER How much data the operating system may hold in flight for one send~2C in bytes. 0 uses the platform default: 4 MB on Windows~2C which would otherwise hold only 64 KB~2C and the system's own tuning on Linux and macOS - right for nearly every connection.

  hadd dccore.swm pg.DCC_PORT_START 8
  hadd dccore.swm n.DCC_PORT_START DCC port range start
  hadd dccore.swm h.DCC_PORT_START The first port the bot listens on when sending a file. If you are behind a router~2C forward this whole range (start to end) to the machine running the bot~2C or nobody can download from you.
  hadd dccore.swm k.DCC_PORT_END 2173 int 1 2172
  hadd dccore.swm pg.DCC_PORT_END 8
  hadd dccore.swm n.DCC_PORT_END DCC port range end
  hadd dccore.swm h.DCC_PORT_END The last port of that range. Sends~2C downloads from other bots and a listen-mode admin console all take their ports from it~2C so keep at least as many ports as your send slots and fetch slots together~2C plus one.
  hadd dccore.swm k.DCC_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT 2177 int 1 2176
  hadd dccore.swm pg.DCC_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT 8
  hadd dccore.swm n.DCC_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT Wait for the receiver to connect (seconds)
  hadd dccore.swm h.DCC_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT How many seconds the bot waits for someone to accept a file it has offered before withdrawing the offer and counting one failed attempt. A person who has to click Accept in a dialog often needs more than the default 30.
  hadd dccore.swm k.MAX_SEND_FAILS 2181 int 1 2180
  hadd dccore.swm pg.MAX_SEND_FAILS 8
  hadd dccore.swm n.MAX_SEND_FAILS Max send failures

  hadd dccore.swm pg.LIST_BASE_NAME 9
  hadd dccore.swm n.LIST_BASE_NAME List base name
  hadd dccore.swm h.LIST_BASE_NAME The name your list files start with (for example DCCore-2026-09-18.txt). Normally the same as the bot's nickname~2C which is what happens if you leave it alone.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;  DCCore Chat - public operator chat, relayed by the bot (#371)
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;  Operators chatting with each other in the channels their bots share.
;  The BOT is the relay: what you type in the chat window goes to the bot
;  over this console (`chat * text`), and the bot says it as an ordinary
;  channel message starting with a tag, in the fewest channels that reach
;  the other DCCore bots (a channel NOTICE is what channel bots kick for).
;  A tagged message from another DCCore bot - recognised by its realname,
;  which the bot looks up with WHO - comes back here as a CHAT line. Your
;  own mIRC does not have to be in any channel.
;
;  The DCCore bots WHO has found are listed to the right of the window
;  (plain nicknames). Double-click one, or right-click it and pick "Message
;  this bot privately", to send there instead - a private message to one
;  known peer (#371 follow-up), never a channel, and never to a nick the
;  bot has not itself found: that is the only proof it has that the other
;  end can see it.
;
;  It is PUBLIC, and says so. A channel message reaches everybody in it;
;  somebody without a chat window sees the line in the channel as it is.
;  The sender is the nick that sent it - your bot, for what you type - and
;  the tag is a presentation filter, not a trust boundary.
;
;  The bot does the checking - the tag as the first word, a sender that is
;  another DCCore bot, its own channels only, control codes out, a per-nick
;  flood limit, a cap on what you send - and keeps the last lines in
;  memory, so a window that reconnects shows what it missed. Each line
;  carries an id (its time in milliseconds), and the window never draws the
;  same one twice.
;
;  This script only ever sends what you typed. Nothing in the message
;  handler or in anything drawing a CHAT line sends anything, so two
;  scripts can never echo each other.
;
;  The tag is neutral so that a script that is not DCCore's can speak it too.
;  It cannot change once people use it.

; made the message vanish for the operator while everyone else in the
; channel still read it. Checked against the same peer list the
; side-listbox is drawn from, so only a line the bot is actually going to
; relay is ever hidden - a peer muted for flooding or over the all-senders
; cap in the few seconds after being confirmed known is the one case this
