;  dccore.mrc - the bot's whole life in one mIRC window
; =====================================================================
;
;  What it does
;    Opens the admin DCC chat to your DCCore bot, logs in by itself, and
;    draws everything the bot reports in one custom window, @DCCore:
;    the feed (requests, queue, sends, failures, searches, bans, joins)
;    coloured per kind, a side panel with what is sending and who is
;    waiting, and a title bar with the slots, the queue and today's
;    totals. Anything you type in the window goes back to the bot as a
;    console command, and the reply comes back into the window.
;
;    And DCCore Chat (#371): a second window for public chat with other
;    operators in the channels you share, over a tagged NOTICE from your
;    own client - see its section near the end of this file.
;
;  Install
;    Save this file anywhere (your mIRC folder is fine), then in mIRC:
;
;        /load -rs dccore.mrc
;        /dccore pair MusicBot         (MusicBot = your bot's nick)
;
;    The window opens and the bot asks for the password: type it in the
;    window ONCE. The script then asks the bot for a login token of its
;    own, keeps it in dccore.ini next to this file, and from then on
;    connects and logs in without you. The token opens the console and
;    nothing else - it cannot open the web dashboard - and
;    /dccore unpair revokes it at any time.
;
;    dccore.ini is CLEAR TEXT (#683): mIRC's hash-table save writes the
;    token readable, beside this file. Treat that file as you would a
;    password file - it is what a copied mIRC folder or a shared PC
;    gives away, not the .mrc - and /dccore unpair the moment you think
;    it has travelled: the bot then refuses that token for good.
;
;    Then:   /dccore              the command list
;            /dccore options      what to show, in which colour
;
;  Requirements
;    mIRC 6.10 or later. Everything used here dates from mIRC 6.x or
;    earlier: custom windows with an editbox and a side listbox
;    (/window -el), /aline -l, /titlebar, on CHAT with ^ to halt the
;    default text, on CHATCLOSE, hash tables with /hsave and /hload,
;    /hinc and /hdel -w, /timer -m, dialog tables with combo, check and
;    edit, $round, $regex, $duration, $qt, $base, and for the window
;    background /background, /bset and /bwrite (a small .bmp of the
;    chosen colour: mIRC has no per-window background colour, only a
;    per-window picture). Nothing from
;    mIRC 7 (no $json, no UTF-8 switches): the wire is plain ASCII, the
;    bot has already turned control characters into spaces, and the only
;    characters above 127 this script draws are the middle dot and the
;    non-breaking space, which every Windows ANSI code page has.
;
;    A bot that answers `hello` - the DCCore this script ships with, or a
;    later one. An older bot answers "Unknown command" and the script drops to plain mode,
;    where the window simply shows the chat as it comes - still coloured
;    by the bot's own theme, still a console, just no panel.
;
;  The protocol is in docs/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md ("The structured feed, for a
;  script"). Ships with DCCore under the same licence.
;
;  Notes for anyone editing this
;    - Every alias is global (no -l): timers run outside the script's
;      scope and cannot reach a local alias. They are all namespaced
;      dccore.* so they collide with nothing.
;    - Text passed through $1- has its runs of spaces collapsed, so all
;      column padding is done with $chr(160), a non-breaking space.
;    - A ";" begins a comment only at the start of a line, and [ ] are
;      evaluation brackets, so a literal bracket is $chr(91)/$chr(93).
;    - Newer mIRC: the floor stays 6.10 for everything the window does.
;      Where a 7.x identifier adds something real, gate it with
;      if ($version >= 7) { } rather than raising the floor. mIRC 7
;      already decodes the chat as UTF-8, so non-ASCII file names show
;      correctly there without any change here.

;  DCCore Chat - public operator chat over a tagged NOTICE (#371)
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;  Operators chatting with each other in the channels they already share,
;  without the bot in the loop: what you type in the chat window goes out
;  from YOUR client as a NOTICE to the channel, starting with a tag, and a
;  NOTICE starting with that tag is caught here, drawn in the window and
;  kept out of the channel view. Nothing else changes: a NOTICE that does
;  not start with the tag is left exactly as mIRC would show it.
;
;  It is PUBLIC, and says so. A NOTICE to a channel reaches everybody in
;  it; somebody without this script sees the line in the channel as it is.
;  The tag is a presentation filter, not a trust boundary: anybody can type
;  it. The nick shown is whatever the server says sent the line.
;
;  Rules it keeps (#371):
;    - the tag is matched as the first word ($1) and nowhere else;
;    - only channels you listen on, or all of them if you ticked that;
;    - NOTHING in the NOTICE handler ever sends anything (RFC 2812: never
;      answer a NOTICE automatically) - replies are typed by a person;
;    - per-nick flood limit on what arrives: past 5 lines in 10 seconds a
;      nick is hidden for 60 seconds, said once, never answered;
;    - colours and control codes are stripped, both ways.
;
;  The tag is neutral on purpose, so a script that is not DCCore's can
;  speak it too. It cannot change once people use it.
