"""What every setting means, read from the one place it is written down.

Every setting in defaults.py carries a comment block above it, and an
inline comment after it for the short ones. scripts/gen_settings_sample.py
has parsed those into settings.conf.sample since the sample was first
generated - one source, so the explanation cannot drift from the code. The
dashboard's Settings page is the third reader (#528): "a lot of settings
are not easy to understand", and the text that explains them already
existed, one file away from the page that needed it.

So the parser lives here, and both the generator and the /api/settings
payload call it. Parsed from the SOURCE with ast, never from the imported
module: the comments are not in the module, and the file is small enough
that a parse per change of defaults.py costs nothing (cached on mtime, so
the dashboard does not re-read it per request).
