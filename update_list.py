    """Every file under `top`, with the size the directory entry already knew.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. os.walk is built on os.scandir, which gets each entry's
    size from the directory enumeration itself - and then throws it away,
    because os.walk's contract is names only. The caller then asks
    os.path.getsize() for a number the filesystem has just finished telling
    us. One redundant syscall per file, and on a network share one redundant
    ROUND TRIP per file.

    Measured on 20,000 files, local SSD, warm cache, both producing the same
    answer:

        os.walk + getsize    0.356s   (17.8 us/file)
        os.scandir + cached  0.095s   ( 4.7 us/file)   3.8x

    That is the WALK. A whole rebuild, timed the same way over 30,000 files
    and producing byte-identical lists, goes 2.51s -> 1.56s: 1.61x, because
    writing and packing are the rest of the job and this does not touch them.
    The walk's share is what grows on a network drive, where the second ask is
    a round trip rather than a cached answer.

    Local disk is the BEST case for the old shape. The library this was
    written for is 799,438 files on a mapped network drive, where a rebuild
    takes fifteen and a half minutes.

    Yields (dirpath, [(name, size), ...]), one tuple per directory, so the
    caller's loop keeps its shape.

    A file whose size cannot be read yields a size of None rather than being
    dropped here. That decision belongs to the caller, which already logs the
    path and excludes it - see the [LIST-GEN ERROR] branch - and a helper that
    silently skipped it would take that log line away.

    `entry.stat()` FOLLOWS symlinks, exactly as os.path.getsize() did, so a
    symlinked track still reports its target's size. On Windows that costs a
    syscall only when the entry really is a symlink; an ordinary file is
    answered from what the enumeration already returned.

    A symlinked DIRECTORY is classified as a directory - `entry.is_dir()`,
    following, exactly as os.walk does when deciding what goes in `dirs` - and
    then not descended into, which is os.walk's followlinks=False default. Two
    decisions, made separately, because collapsing them into
    is_dir(follow_symlinks=False) answers False for a symlinked directory and
    hands it back as a file.

    `onerror` is called with the OSError, matching os.walk's parameter of the
    same name, so an unreadable subtree is reported the way it always was
    rather than ending the scan.

    the archive users actually received was the previous one, the size side
    files still carried the previous numbers, the base-name marker was not

    Each destination is moved ASIDE before its replacement lands, so a failure

    list at all - not because there is no list, but because the one on disk
    is filed under a name nothing is looking for any more. It stays that way
    until the next successful !update, which on a weekly rebuild schedule is
    up to a week of a bot that looks healthy and answers every request with
    "not found". db.migrate_legacy_side_files()'s own docstring describes
    this exact failure shape for the flac-serv-* rename; this is the same
    problem, for a prefix rather than a single filename.

    Deliberately narrow, matching that function's safety properties:

      * only when LIST_BASE_NAME no longer equals what defaults.py ships -
        an install that never had any "DCCore-*" files (fresh, or one that
        chose its own LIST_BASE_NAME from the very first run) has nothing to
        move, and this is a no-op for it.
      * only a file whose new name does not already exist is moved - a
        rebuild that has already happened under the new name wins over
        anything left behind from the old one.
      * os.replace, so an interrupted run leaves one intact file rather than
        two halves; a failure is logged and swallowed per file, because a
        daemon that will not start over a rename is a worse outcome than the
        rename not happening for one file.

    Returns the list of (old, new) basenames actually moved, for the tests
    and for the startup log.

    Free-form: several lines, ASCII art, a channel name - whatever should greet
    whoever opens the file. Everything else written into the list goes through
    _one_line(), which flattens control characters; doing that here would
    destroy the art this exists to carry, so the banner deliberately bypasses
    it.

    TWO LINE SHAPES ARE NEUTRALISED, because the banner is written into the
    body of the master index and the index has a grammar of its own. Found by
    audit, both with the banner working exactly as documented:

      A line that is entirely "=" is a folder RULE to every reader. A banner
      with an odd number of them leaves list.find_matching_entries()'s
      rule/heading/rule machine mid-block, so the next banner line is taken as
      a folder heading and the REAL heading after it is swallowed - every file
      in the first folder is then attributed to a folder that does not exist.
      That value is not cosmetic: the dashboard's duplicate-finder and the
      File Lists view both resolve it. Rewritten to the same width in "-", so
      the box still looks like a box.

      A line beginning with "!" is a request ROW to every reader - the count in
      the advert, the CTCP SLOTS payload, and @find. A banner line like
      "!!! NEW RELEASES !!!" was counted as a file and returned as a genuine
      search hit, so a user could request it and receive nothing. Dropped
      rather than rewritten: there is no edit that keeps such a line looking
      like itself while stopping it being read as a row.

    Both are reported with the offending line, so the operator can change the
    banner rather than wonder what happened to it. Neutralised HERE rather
    than at the point of writing because _split_master_list() removes the
    banner from each split part by matching the exact text this function
    returned - so both sides have to be the same text.

    "" on anything unreadable, matching read_list_base_marker()'s reasoning: a
    banner is decoration, and no decoration should ever stop a list being
    built. A missing file is the normal state, not an error.

    Line endings are normalised to "\\n" because the list is opened without
    newline="", so the writer translates "\\n" to os.linesep itself. A CRLF
    banner written through that untouched would come out "\\r\\r\\n" on Windows.

    read a log they already have open; naming it tells them which folder to go
