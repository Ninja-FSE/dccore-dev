"""Duration and quality for the list's file rows (#567).

    !DCCore Artist - Album - 01 - Track.mp3  ::INFO:: 10.3MB 4m31s 320/44.1/JS
    !DCCore Artist - Album - 02 - Track.flac  ::INFO:: 16.7MB 2m5s 1115/44.1/S

After the size: the duration, then bitrate kbps / sample rate kHz / channels.
The spelling is the one other servers' lists already use, so every reader that
parses theirs - this project's own list.py included - reads ours unchanged. A
VBR MP3's number is its average, marked with a leading "~" (~245/44.1/JS); a
FLAC's is its real bitrate, what the file actually costs per second. Channels:
S stereo, JS joint stereo, DC dual channel, M mono, and "6ch" beyond two.

STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY. Reading audio metadata normally means mutagen, and zero
third-party packages is a property of the project. MP3 and FLAC are the two the
issue asked for and the two these lists are made of; both answer from a seek
and a few KB, never a full read:

- MP3: skip any ID3v2 tags, find the first frame whose header decodes AND whose
  successor sits where the header says, decode version / layer / bitrate /
  sample rate / channel mode, then look inside that frame for a Xing / Info /
  VBRI header, which carries the frame count - the only honest duration for
  VBR. Without one it is CBR and the duration is the audio bytes over the
  bitrate (an ID3v1 tag at the end is not audio).
- FLAC: the "fLaC" magic, then the metadata blocks; STREAMINFO has the sample
  rate, channels and total samples, and where the blocks end is where the audio
  starts - which is what the real bitrate is measured from.

Anything else, and anything these cannot make sense of, is None: the row keeps
its size and nothing more. A malformed file must never take a list build down,
so read() never raises.

FEW REQUESTS PER FILE, MANY FILES AT ONCE. Measured on a real library on an
NFS mount (#914): read one file at a time, with a stat, a 64 KB read and a
seek to the end each, it managed 9.8 files a second - two hours for 64,136
files, every search blocked meanwhile. On a network mount the time is round
trips, not bytes. So each file is opened unbuffered and read in as few
requests as the format allows: one 16 KB read covers the ID3 header, the
first frame and its Xing header, or FLAC's STREAMINFO, in the ordinary case;
a big tag (cover art) or a big picture block costs one more. The ID3v1 tag at
the end is no longer looked for - a request to shave 128 bytes, a few
milliseconds, off a CBR duration. And the files are read several at a
time (LIST_AUDIO_INFO_THREADS), the way QuickList - OmenServe's list maker -
reads them: round trips overlap, bytes do not matter.

THE CACHE, the way QuickList keeps its own: loaded into memory once, checked
against the SIZE the directory scan already knows - no stat, no request, for a
file that has not changed - and written back once. SQLite (stdlib) at
LIST_AUDIO_INFO_CACHE. Rows for files no longer in the library are dropped only
when a rebuild publishes; what a failed or stopped rebuild read is kept.

A TIME LIMIT, so the first run cannot hold the bot. A rebuild pauses searches
and requests (PAUSE_ON_UPDATE), and the first one with this on has every audio
file to read. LIST_AUDIO_INFO_MINUTES bounds it: past the limit no new read is
started, the list publishes with what was read, and the rest keep their size
alone until the next rebuild reads them. Later rebuilds read only new files.
