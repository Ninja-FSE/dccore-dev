"""The library: the ordered set of folders this bot serves from.

DCCore has always served one directory. OmenServe has always served a list of
them, and #164 is that gap. This module is the first step: one place that
answers "which folders, in what order", so the rest of the daemon stops asking
`config.FILE_DIRECTORY` directly.

Nothing here changes behaviour yet. With no folder file on disk - which is
every install today - `folders()` returns exactly one entry built from
FILE_DIRECTORY, so every caller sees what it saw before. The design and the
decisions behind it are on #164.

WHY AN ACCESSOR RATHER THAN A LIST-SHAPED SETTING

FILE_DIRECTORY has 54 references across ten modules, concentrated in dcc.py
(16) and update_list.py (9). Teaching each of them about a list of folders
would mean touching all 54 again when multi-list arrives and the folder set
moves inside a list. Funnelled through here, that later change rebinds one
accessor instead.

WHY A FILE RATHER THAN settings.conf

settings_file.py refuses any list entry containing a comma, because list
settings serialise as ", ".join(...) - and music paths routinely contain one
("D:\\Rock, Metal"). It strips leading and trailing spaces too. So the folder
list needs its own file, and JSON for the same reason KNOWN_BOTS_FILE gives:
the record has more than one field and will grow.

The file is an OVERRIDE, not a replacement. Absent, FILE_DIRECTORY is the
single folder. That means an upgrade writes nothing and migrates nothing; the
file appears the first time an operator saves folders from the dashboard.
