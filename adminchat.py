# adminchat.py - Authenticated DCC CHAT console for the operator.
"""The operator's console: transport, authentication, and the commands.

This file is the whole admin console. It authenticates a session, and it
defines and dispatches every command that session can run - including the
destructive ones (ban, unban, clearqueue, rehash, update). COMMANDS at the
bottom is the complete list.

It said the opposite until #231: "Phase 1: transport and authentication only.
The admin commands themselves are NOT here yet, deliberately." That was true
when the file was written and stopped being true when the dispatcher landed.
It is the first thing anyone reads here, and it claimed a narrow
security-review scope - "who may open a session, and what proves it" - for a
file that also holds every command worth reviewing carefully.

The authentication is still the part to read first, and it is described below.
But it is no longer the only thing here.

WHY DCC CHAT RATHER THAN A CHANNEL OR PM COMMAND
------------------------------------------------
is_admin() compares a nick against ADMIN_NICK, and on Undernet a nick is not
owned without services auth - anyone can take the admin nick while the operator
is offline and inherit every admin command, including !clearqueue.

The gate here is the operator's Undernet services login. When a user logs into X
and sets usermode +x, the server replaces their host with
"<account>.users.undernet.org". Only the server can issue that host, and only to
someone holding that account, so matching the host IS verifying the login - with
no password shared with this bot and nothing to steal from its config.

The socket is then the session. There is no token, no nick binding and no expiry
bookkeeping: it dies when the TCP connection dies. That is the part a PM-based
!auth command can never get right, because it always ends up trusting a nick
again once the password has been accepted.

WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM iroffer
---------------------------------------------
iroffer screens only the remote IP at connect time; its hostmask test lives in
dcc_host_password() and runs together with the password. So iroffer answers a
stranger: it accepts, prints a banner naming its version, build, OS, feature list
and uptime, and prompts.

This one screens the host on the incoming CTCP, before replying at all. A stranger
gets no banner, no connection, no reply of any kind, and no way to learn whether
the mask was wrong. The cost of an unauthorised attempt is one regex.

CONNECTION DIRECTION, AND THE INBOUND SURFACE
---------------------------------------------
The preferred path follows iroffer's non-passive form: the requesting client
listens and supplies its ip/port, and the bot connects OUT to it. That path
opens no listening port.

Both fallbacks do. _open_chat_listener() binds a port in the
DCC_PORT_START..DCC_PORT_END range when the bot cannot dial the operator's
client, and the passive form - the client offering port 0, meaning "you listen
instead" - is parsed and answered with an offer of our own. So this module is
not inbound-surface-free, and the host check is what stands in front of that
surface.

Two earlier claims here were wrong and are corrected rather than deleted,
because both were load-bearing for anyone deciding how much of this file needs
a security review: that no listening port is opened (#217), and that passive
DCC is not supported (#231). parse_offer() has handled port 0 since the
listen-mode work, and tests/test_adminchat.py drives it end to end.

        the burst is also the heartbeat, and a writer parked on queue_lock

        the burst - any line resets the script's timer - and the helper is
