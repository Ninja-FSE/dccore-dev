"""The dashboard's settings pages, over the admin console (#1264).

dccore.mrc's settings window does its work through the console, so an
operator can change the bot's settings from mIRC as they can on the
dashboard's Settings page. Every command here is a thin line protocol over
the dashboard's OWN functions in webserver.py - build_settings_payload() and
apply_settings_changes(), build_lists_payload() and apply_list_changes(),
build_folders_payload() and apply_folder_changes(), the on-connect trio and
the theme preview. Nothing is validated or written a second way: two
implementations of "save a setting" would disagree the first time one of
them changed, and the window would then save something the page refuses.

THE COMMANDS ARE THE CONSOLE'S ONLY. They sit in adminchat.COMMANDS, which
only an authenticated DCC CHAT session and the dashboard's own Console page
(behind the dashboard login) dispatch. The in-channel admin commands are a
fixed handful in irc.py and never reach this table - a test pins that.

TRANSACTIONS. `setbegin`, any number of `set`, then `setcommit` applies them
all in ONE apply_settings_changes() call, so the window's Apply costs one
rehash rather than one per field. The open transaction lives on the session
object, so a disconnect - or a second login taking the console over - drops
it with the session; there is nothing to clean up and no lock to hold, since
one session's commands run one at a time on its own reader thread. The
served lists, the served folders and the on-connect commands have the same
begin / rows / commit shape, because each of their dashboard endpoints takes
the WHOLE set and validates it as a set.

A dashboard Console request is a fresh session every time, so a transaction
opened there would be gone before its first row arrived - and the next `set`
would then apply at once while the operator believed it was buffered. The
transaction commands are refused there, with the reason.

THE VALUES CROSS AS ONE LINE, in their settings.conf form (see
settings_file.render(); a CUSTOM_THEME_* colour as its \\xHH escape text,
exactly as the Settings page shows it), through encode_value() below - which
changes nothing about an ordinary value and makes the rare awkward one (an
empty value, a leading, trailing or doubled space, a control character)
survive a client that collapses spaces, as mIRC does. docs/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md,
"Settings over the console", is the protocol's definition.

NOTHING HERE LOGS A VALUE. The console's dispatcher leaves the lines that
carry one out of the bot's log (see adminchat._UNLOGGED), and a commit logs
the names of what it saved. ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH is never shown, never
accepted and never echoed; an on-connect command - which may well be an X
login with a password in it - is shown to the operator who asks, as the
dashboard shows it, and is never logged (on_connect.py's own rule).
