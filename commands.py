    Two deliberate changes from the copies this replaces:

    * The hardcoded `or user.lower() == "sysop"` fallback is gone. It made the literal nick
      "sysop" an admin regardless of what config.ADMIN_NICK was set to - an undocumented
      second account nobody could turn off. It is a no-op today because ADMIN_NICK is
      already "SysOp", so removing it changes nothing until that value is edited.
    * ADMIN_NICK may now be a comma-separated list, so a second operator can be added
      without reintroducing a hardcoded name.

    KNOWN LIMITATION: this is still nick-based, and an Undernet nick is not owned without
    services auth - anyone can take the nick while the real admin is offline and gain
    every admin command, now including the destructive !clearqueue. Closing that properly
    means matching ident@host, which irc.py does not currently capture: its PRIVMSG regex
    keeps only the nick. That is a separate change to irc.py plus this file.

    rehash_nick_change_line() above was: so this one decision is
    unit-testable without the real importlib.reload() the rest of that

    Why mutate rather than assign: config.py's runtime containers
    (dcc_queue, active_transfers, fetch_queue, ...) are bound to the SAME
    objects runtime.py holds - see runtime.py's own docstring - and
    importlib.reload(config) just re-executes those binding statements, so
    `getattr(cfg, key)` before and after a reload is normally the identical
    object, not a fresh empty one the old "reload rebinds to a fresh empty
    container" assumption this function used to carry along with it.
    `setattr(cfg, key, merged)` here would rebind cfg's name to a brand-new
    container, silently detaching it from runtime.py's object forever -
    every other module that reads cfg.<key> would keep seeing this one
    frozen snapshot while the real object drifted on, unnoticed, until the
    next full process restart. Reproduced exactly that way: a transfer's
    removal from active_transfers on completion never reached the detached
    copy, and came back as a permanent phantom DCC slot on the very next
    rehash - two rehashes in a row is all it took.

    Kept general rather than assuming `value is current` always holds (true
    today for every name in PRESERVE_RUNTIME, since all of them are
    runtime.py-bound) - if a future preserved key ever is NOT bound that
    way, reload really would hand back a fresh, empty container, and the
    merge below still produces the right content; only the final write
    changes, from rebind to in-place mutation.

    Lifted out of handle_list_update_request() so it can be called directly.
    It was a closure over nothing - it reads config and the disk - and being
    one meant the only way to reach it was to run a real !update, subprocess
    and all. A glob-escaping fix to this very function could not be proved by
    any test until it moved out here.

    ONE FINDER, not a second copy of one. This used to glob the lists
    directory and filter for itself, and every time list.py learned to exclude
    another name this did not. #234 was that story with the delivered "-FULL-"
    copy. The film list was it again, and worse: "<base>-VIDEO-<date>.txt"
    sorts after a plain date ("V" > "2"), so this picked the film list, whose
    header reads "List of N Films & Series" and does not match the "List of N
    Files" pattern it was looking for. Every !update reported "0 files, added
    0" while the advert published the real total.

    Worse than a wrong number. The #230 shrink guard in the caller fires on
    `added_files < 0`, and 0 - 0 is never negative - so the one warning that
    catches a partial mount failure publishing a truncated index could never
    fire again. update_list.py's decision to let a missing folder cost only
    its own contents is safe BECAUSE that warning exists; breaking it removed
    the net underneath a deliberate choice, silently.

    Counting rows across every list rather than reading the master list's own
    header is the other half: with film in a list of its own, the header
    reports the music half alone, and !update would announce a smaller number
    than the advert publishes for the same library.
