# Installing DCCore

From a fresh clone to a bot serving files. Ten minutes, most of it waiting for the first list to build.

## Requirements

**Python 3.10 or newer.** Nothing else is required.

The daemon and its test suite are stdlib-only, which is why they run on a bare machine with no `pip install` step:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt      # succeeds, installs nothing
```

Two optional extras:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Web dashboard** | needs Flask — `pip install -r requirements-web.txt`. The bot starts fine without it and says so. |
| **`!rar` album packing** | needs a `rar` binary on `PATH`. Without it, `!rar` refuses with a notice; ordinary transfers are unaffected. |

Developed on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, including Proxmox LXC) and runs on Windows — the platform differences live in `platform_compat.py`, and CI covers both. Windows operators should also read [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md).

## Guided setup

```bash
python3 configure.py
```

On Windows that command is **`py configure.py`**. A python.org install gives you `py` and `python`, not `python3` — and Windows 10 and 11 ship an App Execution Alias for that exact name, so `python3` opens the Microsoft Store or reports *"Python was not found"* even when Python is installed and working. Every `python3` below has the same Windows form; [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md) uses it throughout.

Six questions — nickname, IRC server, channel(s), admin nick, admin console password, and the music directory — written to `settings.conf` and `admin_config.py` for you.

The music directory is optional here. It is usually easier to browse and confirm it from the dashboard's Settings page once the bot is running than to type a path blind. Everything else stays changeable afterwards.

Safe to run again later: every prompt shows what is already configured as its default.

## Configuring it by hand

`configure.py` is a convenience, not a requirement. There are two mechanisms and you can use either or both.

**`settings.conf`** — plain text, no Python syntax. Copy `settings.conf.sample` and edit. This is what the dashboard's Settings page and the admin console both write to.

**`admin_config.py`** — Python. Copy `admin_config.py.sample` and edit. Better for values you would rather keep out of a file other tools rewrite, such as `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.

Both are gitignored. `defaults.py` applies `admin_config.py` first and `settings.conf` second, so a value set in both takes the `settings.conf` one.

### What must be set

The daemon refuses to start until `NICKNAME`, `CHANNEL` and `ADMIN_NICK` have values, no matter how it is launched. Leaving them at their shipped blanks would mean joining somebody else's channels under a name that is not yours.

Three things are deliberately *not* required:

- **`SERVER`** and **`DEBUG_CHANNEL`** — their shipped values are already right for almost every install, so requiring them would only make you retype something correct. `DEBUG_CHANNEL` ships blank, and blank means no debug channel is joined.
- **`FILE_DIRECTORY`** — requiring it would block the daemon from reaching the dashboard, which is the easiest place to set it. A blank one warns, at the pre-flight check and again at boot, and the bot serves nothing until it has one.

### Disk the dashboard uses

The List Browser's filter searches every bot list you have downloaded at once, which needs a search index at `data/list_index.db`. It is built as each list is fetched and is roughly the size of the lists again — ten large lists can mean several hundred megabytes. `LIST_INDEX_FILE` moves it. Deleting it is safe: the filter stops working until the next fetch rebuilds it, and nothing else uses it.

## Check before you start

Verify the setup without connecting to IRC. This catches the mistakes that actually cause trouble — most often a music directory that is set but does not exist:

**Linux**
```bash
./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh check
```

**Windows**
```bat
scripts\windows\start-dccore.bat check
```

## Start it

Once the check reports *Ready to start*, drop the argument:

```bash
./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh
```

```bat
scripts\windows\start-dccore.bat
```

Both re-run the check first and anchor their own working directory, so they work from a cron job, a systemd unit, a shortcut or a double-click.

To start the daemon directly instead:

```bash
python3 oserve.py
```

## Build the first list

The bot has nothing to serve until its library has been scanned:

```bash
python3 update_list.py
```

or `!update` from IRC, or the dashboard's **Update list** button. On a large library this takes a while; the advert will report the real file count once it finishes.

**Everything under `FILE_DIRECTORY` goes into the list** — every format, and files with no extension at all. `LIST_IGNORED_EXTENSIONS` names what to leave out; write it however you like, since dots and spacing are optional and case does not matter (`db,ini,tmp` and `.DB, .INI, .TMP` are the same list). It ships skipping only what is never a real file: `.db`, `.ini`, `.lnk`, `.url`, and the `.tmp`/`.part`/`.crdownload`/`.!ut` suffixes of downloads still in flight. The scan prints what it is skipping before it starts.

Because everything is listed, **anything you leave in that directory is offered to anyone who asks.** It is the public face of the bot — keep out of it whatever should not leave.

Two settings decide how the result is split up:

- **`SEPARATE_VIDEO_LIST`** — publishes film and series as their own list rather than mixing them in with the music. Both travel in the same archive people get by typing your bot's name, so there is no second command to learn. `LIST_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS` says which formats count. Turn it off if your films and music are already in separate folders and you would rather split by folder.
- **`RAR_EXTENSIONS`** — which formats make a folder packable with `!rar`. A folder needs one of these to get a row in the album list. Everything else stays listed and directly requestable; this only decides what can be packed. **`MAX_RAR_FOLDER_SIZE`** bounds how large a folder `!rar` will pack — 10 GB by default, which passes a large box set and refuses the folder somebody names hoping it is a library. Set it to 0 for no limit.

### If your users queue with AutoQ

AutoQ (the mIRC queue script most of these channels use) pastes list rows into
a queue window and sends them one at a time. Two things about it are worth
knowing when you decide which file types to serve.

**It only queues rows whose extension is in mIRC's own accept list.** AutoQ
adds `*.mp3` and `*.rar` to that list when it loads, and nothing else. A row
for any other type — `.flac`, `.mkv`, `.m4a`, `.zip` — is **silently dropped**
when pasted: no line appears in the queue, and nothing says why. The row on
your list is correct; the client discards it.

Since DCCore lists every file in your library by default (minus
`LIST_IGNORED_EXTENSIONS`), tell your users to add the types you actually
serve. In mIRC that is **Options → DCC → the accept list**, or by hand in
`mirc.ini` under `[text] accept`, as a comma-separated list of `*.ext`
patterns. If most of your library is `.flac`, this is the difference between
your list working for them and half of it appearing to do nothing.

**Requesting your list from AutoQ's menu works.** Its "Get Listfile" item
sends `@yourbotname` with a tag appended, and DCCore answers a list request
with anything after the nickname. Its "Que Status" item sends
`yourbotname-que` without the leading `@`, which DCCore does **not** answer —
`@yourbotname-que` typed by hand is the form that works.

### Putting your own banner on it

Every generated list starts with the file count, the request instructions, and a line naming the bot and this project. Below that you can put anything you like — a greeting, your channel, ASCII art — by creating one file:

```bash
nano data/list_header.txt
```

Whatever it contains is copied into the top of the `.txt`, `.zip` and `.rar` lists on the next `!update`. There is nothing to enable: the file not existing is the normal state, and means no banner.

Three things worth knowing:

- It is copied **verbatim**, so box-drawing characters and ASCII art survive intact. Nothing is reformatted or stripped.
- Keep lines to roughly **80 characters**. The folder headings below are drawn to the width of the folder they frame, so a much wider banner reads as broken next to them.
- It is capped at `LIST_HEADER_MAX_BYTES` (8 KB by default). Past that the banner is truncated and the run says so, rather than quietly stapling a large file onto every list request.
- **Do not start a line with `!yourbotname`.** The list is read by scripts as well as people — AutoQ copies request lines straight out of it and sends them — so a banner line beginning with your own trigger reads as a request for a file that does not exist. Anything else is fine; it is only the first word of a line that matters.

mIRC colour codes work if your audience reads the list in mIRC, but they show as stray characters in a plain text editor — worth deciding which of the two matters more for your channel.

## Upgrading

Your settings and data are never touched by an upgrade: `settings.conf`, `admin_config.py` and everything under `data/` are gitignored, so updating the code cannot overwrite them. That is also the one thing to watch — see step 4.

**1. Stop the daemon.** A transfer in progress will be cut off, so a quiet moment is kinder than mid-queue.

**2. Back up `data/` and your config.** It holds your stats, ban list, download counts and speed record — none of it recoverable if something goes wrong.

```bash
cp -r data data.backup && cp settings.conf admin_config.py data.backup/
```

**3. Get the new version.**

```bash
git pull
```

If you installed from a downloaded release rather than a clone, download the new release and unpack it over the top — your gitignored files are not in the archive, so they survive. Keep `data/` where it is.

**4. Check for new settings.** This is the step people miss. `settings.conf` is gitignored, so `git pull` updates `settings.conf.sample` but never your own file. New settings do not appear in it, and you will not hear about them.

```bash
comm -23 <(grep -oE '^#?[A-Z_]+ *=' settings.conf.sample | tr -d '# =' | sort) \
         <(grep -oE '^[A-Z_]+ *=' settings.conf | tr -d ' =' | sort)
```

That lists every setting the sample knows about and your file does not. Most of them will be settings you were happy to leave at their defaults, so read it as "what exists", not as a to-do list.

Nothing breaks if you skip this — every setting has a working default and the daemon runs fine without any of them being present. You simply will not know what became available. The changelog is the readable version of the same information.

**5. Read the changelog.** [UPDATES.md](UPDATES.md) says what changed and, where it matters, what you have to do about it.

**6. Verify before going live.**

```bash
./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh check
```

This checks the configuration without connecting to IRC, so a mistake surfaces before your channel sees it. Windows: `scripts\windows\start-dccore.bat check`.

**7. Start it, and rebuild the list if the changelog says the list output changed.**

```bash
./scripts/linux/start-dccore.sh
```

The master list is only regenerated when you ask. If a release changes what the list contains, the file you are serving keeps its old content until the next `!update` — which looks like the upgrade did nothing.

### Coming from v1.11.0 or earlier

The list build changed what it puts in the list, so three things are worth knowing before you restart.

**Your list will not change until you rebuild it.** The daemon keeps serving the list already on disk; run `!update` (or press **Update list** on the dashboard) when you are ready. That is your chance to look at the result before anyone else does.

**It will then contain everything under `FILE_DIRECTORY`, not just `.mp3` and `.flac`.** Video, `.m4a`, artwork, cue sheets, text files — all of it. Check what is actually in that directory first: anything sitting there is offered to anyone who asks. `LIST_IGNORED_EXTENSIONS` names what to leave out, and ships skipping only what is never a real file (`.db`, `.ini`, `.lnk`, `.url`, and half-finished downloads).

**Some folders will stop being `!rar`-packable.** A folder used to become packable by containing anything in the list; now it needs a file in `RAR_EXTENSIONS`, which ships as the audio formats. So a folder of video or documents no longer gets a row in the album list — deliberately, since packing has no size cap and a film folder is a request to compress tens of gigabytes. Individual files in those folders are still listed and still requestable by name.

If you keep video, it also gets its own list from now on, travelling in the same archive people already receive. `SEPARATE_VIDEO_LIST = No` puts everything back in one list.

### Coming from a version before the `config.py` → `defaults.py` rename

Your own overrides file was called `local_config.py` and is gitignored, so `git pull` cannot rename it for you. **Do not copy `admin_config.py.sample` over the top** — that strands your real settings. Just start the daemon once and it renames the file itself, keeping every setting in it. The launchers and the pre-flight check both say so if they meet that state.
