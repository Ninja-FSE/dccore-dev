# DCCore Admin Console (DCC CHAT)

Administrative access over an authenticated DCC CHAT session instead of channel
commands.

**Status: complete.** The console authenticates, runs the full admin command
set, and can receive the daemon's runtime reports instead of the debug channel.
Everything stays as it was until you choose otherwise: with `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS`
empty, every DCC CHAT request is ignored and the daemon behaves exactly as
before.

---

## Why

`is_admin()` compares a nick against `ADMIN_NICK`. On Undernet a nick is not owned
without services auth, so anyone can take the admin nick while you are offline and
inherit every admin command, including the destructive `!clearqueue`. With
`ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` set, the channel and private-message commands check the sender's
host as well as the nick (see "The admin commands typed in a channel" below); with
it empty they are still checked on the nick alone.

The console replaces that with two independent factors:

1. **Your Undernet services login**, proved by your host.
2. **A password**, which never travels through the IRC network.

Stealing your nick gets an attacker nothing without your X account. Learning the
password gets them nothing from the wrong host.

---

## How the host proves your login

When you log into **X** and set usermode `+x`, the Undernet server replaces your
host with:

```
<your-account>.users.undernet.org
```

Only the server can issue that host, and only to someone holding that account. So
matching the host *is* verifying your services login — no password is shared with
this bot, and there is nothing in its config for an attacker to steal.

> **The ident is deliberately ignored.**
> In `nick!ident@host` the ident half is supplied by your client — anyone can set
> theirs to `alex`. Only the host is issued by the server. DCCore discards the
> nick and ident parts of any configured mask on purpose: constraining them would
> grant no security while breaking the moment your client's ident setting changes.

---

## Setup

### 1. Make sure you are authed and hidden

In your IRC client:

```
/msg X@channels.undernet.org login <youraccount> <yourpassword>
/mode <yournick> +x
```

Then check what the network now sees:

```
/whois <yournick>
```

You are looking for a host ending in `.users.undernet.org`. If you still see your
ISP hostname, `+x` did not take and the console will not let you in.

### 2. Generate a password hash

`python3 configure.py` does this step for you - the same password prompt as
below, writing the resulting hash straight into `admin_config.py` - if you
have not already run it. **It also offers step 3**, optionally: your services
host, straight after the admin nick question, blank to skip (#811). Answer it
and `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` is set for you, in `settings.conf`; leave it blank and
the console ignores every DCC CHAT without a word until you set it by hand as
step 3 shows, or on the dashboard's **Settings → Admin console** page. To do
the hash by hand instead:

From the DCCore directory, on either platform:

```
python src/adminchat.py
```

It prompts twice, then prints a line ready to paste:

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH = "pbkdf2_sha256$200000$3f0a...$91c4..."
```

The password itself is never stored — only a salted PBKDF2-SHA256 digest, and it
is compared in constant time. Two hashes of the same password look different,
which is the salt doing its job.

### 3. Put both values in `admin_config.py`

Create `admin_config.py` next to `defaults.py` if it does not exist. **It is
gitignored**, so nothing here reaches GitHub. Do not put these in `defaults.py`.

```python
# admin_config.py

ADMIN_HOSTMASKS = ["*!*@operator.users.undernet.org"]

ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH = "pbkdf2_sha256$200000$3f0a...$91c4..."

# Optional. "auto" (default), "listen", or "connect" - see "Using it" below.
# Behind a VPN or a router that does not forward the port, use "listen".
ADMIN_CHAT_MODE = "auto"

# Optional. Set False to retire the in-channel admin commands - see below.
ADMIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS = True
```

The mask may be written either way — both mean the same thing, because only the
part after the last `@` is used:

```python
ADMIN_HOSTMASKS = ["operator.users.undernet.org"]        # bare host
ADMIN_HOSTMASKS = ["*!*@operator.users.undernet.org"]    # familiar IRC form
```

Wildcards work, and more than one entry is allowed:

```python
ADMIN_HOSTMASKS = ["operator.users.undernet.org", "operator2.users.undernet.org"]
```

A pattern that reduces to bare `*` is refused and logged — it would admit the
whole network and make the gate decorative. A pattern that is accepted but
names far more than one operator is warned about at start-up, on `!rehash` and
by `setup_check.py`, and still works as written: `*.users.undernet.org` puts
the wildcard where your account name goes, so every X-authenticated user on
the network reaches the password prompt; `*.org` names a top-level domain. The
documented shape is your own services host in full.

### 4. Restart the daemon

`admin_config.py` is read at import. `!rehash` reloads `config`, so it picks up
changes too, but a restart is the sure thing while you are setting this up.

## Using it

**Using mIRC?** `scripts/mirc/dccore.mrc` turns the console into one
window - the feed coloured per kind, a side panel with what is sending and
who is waiting, the slots and today's totals in the title bar - and logs in
by itself. See [The window, in mIRC](#the-window-in-mirc) below; the rest
of this section is what happens underneath it.

**Would rather not open a second IRC client at all?** The web dashboard's
Console page runs the exact same command set and shows the exact same live
log, in the browser, behind the same password — see the Console entry in
the dashboard's own nav once `WEBUI_ENABLED` is on. Everything below still
applies to it except the connection steps, which do not exist over HTTP.

From your IRC client:

```
/dcc chat DCCore
```

There are two ways the connection gets made, and the daemon picks whichever can
work:

1. **Your client listens, the bot dials in.** The normal path, and iroffer's
   non-passive branch. Needs no port on the bot's side at all.
2. **The bot listens and offers back.** Used when your client's offer cannot be
   dialled — it asked for **passive (reverse) DCC**, or it does not know its own
   address and sent `0.0.0.0`. The bot takes a port from
   `DCC_PORT_START`–`DCC_PORT_END`, the same range already forwarded for DCC
   SEND, and advertises the public IP it resolved at startup. A passive request
   carries a token, and the bot echoes it back so your client can match the
   reply to the request it is waiting on. Your client then shows an incoming
   chat request to accept.

If the dial fails for any reason — refused, or timed out — the bot falls back to
path 2 automatically. Nothing is lost except the connect timeout.

`ADMIN_CHAT_MODE` in `admin_config.py` controls this:

| value | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `"auto"` | dial, and listen instead if that fails *(default)* |
| `"listen"` | always listen and offer back — never dial |
| `"connect"` | only ever dial; never listen |

**Set it to `"listen"` if your client is behind a VPN**, a router that does not
forward the port, or a firewall that drops rather than rejects. All three show up
as a `timed out` on the dial, and `"auto"` then pays that full timeout on every
single login before falling back. The bot's own listener needs no such luck — it
is the same one every DCC SEND already uses.

Path 1 is tidier when it works (one dialog instead of two). In mIRC:
**Options → Connect → Local Info**, tick *On connect, always get IP address*, and
set the lookup method to **Server**.

### What you can see

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `status` | everything at a glance — slots, queue, bans, list, uptime |
| `queue [nick]` | queued files, all users (in the order they are served) or one nick's files, numbered |
| `slots` | what is sending right now, and how far along |
| `packing` | the folder pack that is running: for whom, which folder (its name, never its path), how long, and the archive's size so far against the folder's (#1202) |
| `packcancel` | stop the folder pack that is running: `rar` is terminated, the partial archive is deleted, the user is told it was cancelled (no failure is counted against the request), and the next waiting pack starts. "Nothing is being packed." when none runs (#1202) |
| `bans` | permanent and timed bans |
| `uptime` | how long the daemon has been running |
| `version` | build and platform |
| `checkversion` | ask GitHub now whether a newer DCCore is out; works with `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` off, once a minute |
| `verify` | filenames that appear in two folders |

### What you can do

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ban <pattern>` | add a permanent wildcard ban |
| `unban <pattern>` | remove one |
| `queuemove <nick> up\|down` | move a nick one place up or down the line for a free slot (#1206); `queue` lists the nicks in that order. Only the two nicks swap places; nobody else's moves. A nick with a list waiting is served first, so nobody is moved past it - that is refused, with the place the nick keeps. The order is kept in memory only: a restart puts it back to first-come |
| `queuemove <nick> <number> up\|down` | move one of a nick's queued files up or down in its own queue — the one at the top is sent first. A file being sent or packed stays put and nothing is moved past it. The number is the one `queue <nick>` shows |
| `queueremove <nick> <number>` | take one file out of a nick's queue, as if they had typed `@<bot>-remove <file>`: same notice to them, `clearqueue` removes the lot. A file being sent is not removed, nor a folder being packed (`packcancel` stops that) |
| `ignore <nick> <minutes>` | drop one nick's requests for a while, 1 to 10080 minutes (#1206). It is a timed ban: kept across a restart, ends by itself, listed by `bans` with the time left. Its queued files stay; `clearqueue` removes them |
| `clearandignore <nick> <minutes>` | `ignore`, then `clearqueue` the same nick - but only if the ignore actually took (the bot's own nick, and a nick outside the pattern `ignore` accepts, are refused and the queue is left alone). dccore.mrc's "Clear the queue of ... and ignore for..." sends this one command instead of the two separately (#1247) |
| `unignore <nick>` | end a timed ignore - or a flood ban - now |
| `clearqueue <nick>` | force-clear another user's queue |
| `rehash` | reload modules in place |
| `update` | rebuild the MasterList |
| `audioinfo` | read the length and quality of the audio files the list has none for yet, and write them in - no new scan; "nothing new to read" when there is nothing, refused while a rebuild or another reading runs (a rebuild reads by itself once it has published). Only with `LIST_SHOW_AUDIO_INFO` on (#1182) |
| `lists` | the bots' lists we hold, whether each has changed since we took our copy, how big and how old |
| `fetch [<bot>]` | ask every held bot whose list has changed (up to 10 at a time, skipping offline ones), or one bot whatever its freshness |
| `purgealllists confirm` | forget EVERY held bot list, online or not - each rebuilds on its own (a changed advert, or a fresh fetch) with its channel resolved clean. Recommended once after upgrading from before v1.16, since an older list's channel can be stuck wrong (#1260) |
| `downloads on [<rows>]` / `downloads off` | the mIRC Downloads window opened (with how many finished and failed rows it wants, 1-15) or closed; the bot sends its `DLBEGIN` snapshots only in between (#1022) |
| `dlcancel <id> [<id> ...]` / `dlcancel all` | let downloads go that have not started (waiting, asked, queued there); never a transfer under way or a finished one. Each id is judged on its own; `all` is every request that has not started (#1217) |
| `dlqueue` | every request that has not started, for the mIRC Download queues window (`DQBEGIN` snapshot), or as text with the ids for a console that cannot draw it (#1217) |
| `dlagain <id>` | ask again for a download or list that failed; the old row stays |
| `dlclear` | forget every finished download (the files stay on disk) |
| `chat [#channel\|* <text>]` | say something in DCCore Chat, as the bot, in one channel or (`*`) the fewest that reach the other DCCore bots - **public**, see below; alone, the channels it can chat in |
| `chat peers` / `chat who` | the other DCCore bots seen by WHO, and ask WHO again now |
| `settings [<word>]` | every setting the dashboard's Settings page offers, with its value, grouped as the page groups them; with a word, only the settings whose name contains it (#1264) |
| `set <KEY> <value>` | change one setting through the Settings page's own save, which starts a rehash; an empty value clears it. Inside `setbegin` it is buffered instead. Refused with the page's own reason - a value it would not save, a name it does not offer, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` always. Clearing `DEBUG_CHANNEL` asks first: `setcommit confirm` goes ahead, `setabort` does not |
| `setbegin` | start buffering `set` lines, to save as one: Apply in the settings window is one save and one rehash, not one per field. A second `setbegin` drops the first transaction (it says how many changes it dropped); a disconnect drops it too |
| `setcommit [confirm]` | save everything buffered since `setbegin` in one go - or nothing, if any `set` in it was refused. A value equal to the current one is not written at all, so sending a page back untouched saves nothing |
| `setabort` | drop the buffered changes |
| `setpreview` | the sample advert and transfer notice drawn in the theme the open transaction would save (`THEME`, the `CUSTOM_THEME_*` colours, `SEARCH_ENABLED`), or in the saved one when none is open - the dashboard's preview, in colour |
| `served` | the lists this bot serves: their names, which is primary, the channels each is bound to with the channel's mode (`normal`, `quiet`, `request_only`), and their folders. `served begin`, then `served list` / `served chan` / `served folder` rows and `served commit` replace the whole set, as the dashboard's lists page does (`served abort` drops it) |
| `folders` | the served folders of a bot with one list (the dashboard's folder rows on "Your list"); `folders begin`, `folders row` rows and `folders commit` replace them (`folders abort` drops it) |
| `onconnect` | the commands sent to the server once registered, in full (an X login with its password included, as the dashboard shows it - never in the bot's log), and the seconds between them; `onconnect begin`, `onconnect delay`, `onconnect line` rows and `onconnect commit` replace them (`onconnect abort` drops it); `onconnect resend` sends the saved ones again now |
| `banlist` | the permanent ban patterns and the timed bans and ignores with the seconds left, as rows for the settings window; `bans` is the same for a person |
| `consolecaps` | which of the settings window's commands this bot has, and their protocol versions |
| `unlock <password>` | let a session that logged in with a paired token change settings: the admin password, checked as the login checks it, once per session. A session that logged in with the password is unlocked already. Three wrong passwords close the session, as at the login; the line is never logged |
| `help` | the command list |
| `hello <client> <version>` | switch this session to the structured feed (below) |
| `pair <client> <version>` | mint a login token for a script (below) |
| `unpair [<client>]` | list the paired scripts, or revoke one |
| `shutdown now` | stop the bot, the way Ctrl-C in its window does: it leaves IRC and ends (`shutdown` alone says how) |
| `quit` | close the session |

`lists` and `fetch` are the console side of the List Browser's freshness check and
its automatic refresh. `fetch` goes through the same enqueue as the dashboard's
button, so the slot limits, the duplicate guard and the queue ceiling are the same,
and the lists arrive as their transfers finish - a structured client is told with
a `LISTFETCH` line when one is asked for automatically, arrives, or cannot be used.

`rehash` and `update` run in the background — `update` walks the whole library
and can take minutes — so the console stays usable while they work. Their
progress arrives in the session as it happens, because an authenticated console
receives the daemon's runtime log alongside the debug channel. With
`LIST_SHOW_AUDIO_INFO` on, `update` reports done as soon as the list is
published; the audio files it has no length for yet are then read in the
background (`Audio info: reading 12,000 files in the background`), and its end
arrives the same way (`Audio info: done: 11,980 read, 20 unreadable, list
updated`). How far it has got is in the @DCCore panel (dccore.mrc 1.12 and
later), on the dashboard and in the bot's own window, not in the session:
`audioinfo` asked while a reading runs says it. `audioinfo` runs that reading
on its own, and answers with what happened - started, already reading, refused
while a rebuild runs, or off.

### Your nick does not matter here

The five admin commands normally check the caller's nick against `ADMIN_NICK`.
A console session skips that check, on purpose: it has already proved your
services login through your `+x` host **and** a password, which is a stronger
claim than a nick anyone can take while you are offline. So the console works
even when your current nick is not in `ADMIN_NICK` — after a `433` collision,
for instance.

---

## Where the runtime reports go

`send_debug` is the daemon's running commentary — transfers, joins, bans, pack
failures. It has two destinations, both on by default:

| | |
|---|---|
| `DEBUG_TO_CHANNEL` | the coloured line in `DEBUG_CHANNEL`, as always |
| `DEBUG_TO_CONSOLE` | the plain text in an attached admin console - and, for `dccore.mrc`, the structured feed's event lines too: off means the window goes quiet, not just its `LOG` lines |

Once the console is doing the job, in `admin_config.py`:

```python
DEBUG_TO_CHANNEL = False
```

The daemon's internals then stop being published to a channel other people can
sit in.

**Neither switch can lose a line.** If the channel is off and no console happens
to be connected, `send_debug` falls back to stdout — so the LXC console and the
journal always have it. That case, something going wrong while nobody is
watching, is the one worth protecting. It is a floor, not a third destination:
when the channel or a console did take the line, nothing extra is printed.

### In colour

The chat window is an IRC client, so the tag on each line - `[SENT]`,
`[FAIL]`, `[REQUEST]`, `[SECURITY]` - is coloured the same way it is in the
debug channel, in whatever theme the bot uses. `ADMIN_CHAT_COLOURS`
(**Settings → Admin console**) turns that off for a client that shows the
codes as junk; off gives plain `[TAG] text`. The dashboard's Console page is
never coloured.

### The transfer feed

The console tells the whole story of a transfer, one line per event, the way
an OmenServe operator sees it inside mIRC:

```
[REQUEST] dave asked for "Song.flac"
[QUEUED]  Queued "Song.flac" for dave at #2 (3/3 slots busy)
[SENDING] Sending "Song.flac" to dave (slot 2/3)
[RESUMED] Resumed "Song.flac" for dave at 1.0GB of 1.5GB
[SENT]    Sent: "Song.flac" to dave [1.5 MB/s]
[FAIL]    Failed: "Song.flac" to dave - the receiver stopped acknowledging at 1,200,000 of 2,700,000 bytes ...
[SEARCH]  dave searched "metal" - 12 results
```

**Settings → Console feed** has a tickbox per kind — requests, queue positions,
sends (starting, resuming, completing), failures, searches — all on by default.
An unticked kind is dropped, not diverted: it does not fall through to the
stdout floor, because the floor is for a line nobody was there to take, not one
you asked not to see. The tickboxes govern the console and the dashboard's
Console page only. Everything that is not one of those kinds — joins, parts,
bans, config warnings — is never affected by them.

The IRC debug channel is deliberately separate. `Sent:` and `Failed:` go there
under `DEBUG_TO_CHANNEL` as they always have; the feed's other events
(requests, queue positions, starts, resumes, searches) go there only with
`DEBUG_CHANNEL_FEED` on, which ships **off**: every channel line takes a
`MSG_DELAY` slot on the same pacer as the adverts, the resume replies and the
queue notices, so on a busy bot a chatty feed there delays the things people
are waiting for. The console has no such cost.

A console that has been switched on but is *not connected* counts as nobody
listening, and so does a console whose sink raised. Both fall through to stdout.

### The short list, next to the long one

The Console and the debug channel are a **log**: everything the daemon does,
in order. That is the right shape for reading back what happened, and the
wrong shape for *"did anything go wrong while I was asleep?"* - everything is
in it, so nothing stands out.

The dashboard's status panel carries the other shape. When something happens
that changed the bot's ability to do its job, a coloured badge appears under
the queue counts saying how many things are waiting to be looked at. Clicking
it opens **What happened**, which lists them newest first, and **Mark all
read** clears the badge.

Two severities, and the difference is whether it is over:

| | |
|---|---|
| amber | it happened, and it is finished. Kicked from a channel and rejoined. |
| red | it is still true. Gave up rejoining a channel; a list rebuild that failed. |

The badge takes the worse of the two, and it counts only what has not been
marked read - so a red that was acknowledged last week does not keep it lit.

**There is no badge at all when there is nothing unread.** It is not a panel
that sits there showing a zero; it means something by appearing.

What raises one, and nothing else does:

- being kicked from a channel (amber - a rejoin is already scheduled)
- giving up on a channel after the configured number of rejoin attempts (red)
- a list rebuild that failed or timed out (red)

DCCore banning or muting a **user** does not, and that is deliberate: it is
routine, it happens often, and a badge that counts routine events is a badge
nobody reads. The Console still logs every one of them.

The notices are kept in `data/notices.json` and survive a restart, which is
the point of them - the events worth a badge are the ones that happen while
nobody is looking. The last 200 are kept; `NOTICES_FILE` moves the file, and
deleting it is safe.

### Getting rid of a downloaded list

Nothing used to remove one. A bot's list, once fetched, stayed in the List
Browser forever - including for a bot that had renamed, left, or would never
reconnect. Open the list and press **Purge this list** under the file table.

It removes three things together, because leaving any one of them behind makes
the operation a lie:

- the entry, or the browser keeps offering a list whose files are gone
- the extracted files under `FETCHED_FILES_DIR/lists/<bot>/`, which is the
  disk you were trying to get back
- the bot's rows in the cross-list search index, which is roughly as large
  again as the lists it describes

The button appears only where it can do something: not for your own lists,
whose files are your library, and not for a bot you have merely seen
advertising. It asks first, because **fetching the list again is the only way
back** and that needs the bot to still be around.

It refuses while a fetch from that bot is running or queued - that fetch would
write into the directory being deleted, and it would put back what you just
removed. Wait for it to finish, or delete the fetch from Downloads first.

**To clear out several at once**, use **Purge offline bots' lists** in the
toolbar above the bot list instead. That one takes every bot showing the red
dot - offline right now - and leaves alone anything grey ("cannot tell yet",
which is what every bot looks like before the daemon has finished joining its
channels). Use the per-list button when you want a specific one gone whatever
its dot: a bot that renamed, a list fetched by mistake, or one of a pair of
rows left by a bot that reconnected under its alternate nickname.

### Messages people send the bot

The bot answers commands. Anything else sent to it privately - *"are you
there?"*, *"how do I get X?"* - gets **no reply**, and that is deliberate: a
bot that answers every stray line is one that can be made to flood itself off
the network.

It is written down now, which it never used to be. The dashboard's
**Messages** page lists who wrote and what they said, newest first, with an
unread count on the tab. **Mark all read** clears it.

What is recorded, and nothing else:

- **private** messages only - a channel line is one you can already see;
- that are **not** a recognised command - a file asked for privately
  (`!<nick> <file>`) is a request and is answered, so it is never one of them;
- that are **not** a CTCP (a DCC offer or a VERSION reply is a client talking
  to a client, not a person);
- from somebody who is **not banned** - a ban silences them here too.

**One message per person every five minutes.** Somebody typing four lines
because the first got no answer is one person asking one thing, and four rows
of it buries the next person who writes. `PRIVATE_MESSAGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`
changes it; 0 records everything.

The last 50 are kept, in `data/private_messages.json`, and they survive a
restart. **You cannot reply from the page** - the bot has no conversation
path, and a reply box would be a promise it cannot keep. Message them from
your own client.

## Retiring the channel commands

`!ban`, `!unban`, `!rehash`, `!update` and `!clearqueue` still work when typed in
a channel. That is deliberate for now — locking yourself out of every admin
command because a hostmask has a typo in it would be a poor introduction.

Once the console has proved itself, in `admin_config.py`:

```python
ADMIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS = False
```

Admin authority then rests entirely on the services host plus the password, and
no longer on a nick. You do not have to turn them off to be safe from a stolen
nick, though: with `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` set, `!ban`, `!unban`, `!rehash`, `!update`,
`!clearqueue`, `!ping` and `!debugnames` typed in a channel or a private message
are honoured only when the nick is in `ADMIN_NICK` **and** the sender's host
matches one of the masks - the same test the console uses, so a host that lets you
into the console lets you use these too, and a nick somebody else has taken does
not. A line that does not say where it came from is refused. With
`ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` empty the check is the nick alone, as it always was. The user commands — `!list`, `@find`, the queue triggers —
are not affected either way. `!ping` and `!debugnames` are the operator's
diagnostics rather than user commands: they answer only a nick in `ADMIN_NICK`
(and, being channel commands, keep doing so with `ADMIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS` off).

## The structured feed, for a script

A client that draws a window - `dccore.mrc` is the one this exists for - wants
fields, not prose. After logging in, send one console command:

```
hello dccore.mrc 1.1
```

The bot answers `DCCORE HELLO 1.1 <botnick> <version>` and, from then on, every
line it sends on this session starts with `DCCORE`. The second word of your
`hello` is your client's own version, and the bot reads it: one older than
the oldest script that reads this bot's lines right (`1.1`, the first to know
the channel field) is answered, right after `HELLO`, with a plain line saying
to update the script - the feed still switches on, since the major is the
same, but a field will read wrong until you do. A bot without this feature
answers `Unknown command: hello` instead - stay in prose mode. The number in
`HELLO` is the protocol version as `major.minor` (a bot from before the minor
was added says a bare `1`): refuse a major you do not know; a minor you do not
know means a fixed field has been inserted on one side - the lines still
parse, but a field is not where you expect it - so warn, and update whichever
side is older. The minor goes up every time a field is inserted; the free-text
field is always last, so appending nothing ever moves.

Every line is **space-separated positional tokens, with the one free-text
field last** - so in mIRC it is `$1`, `$2`, ... and `$N-`. Numbers are raw
bytes and seconds; you format them. Tabs and control characters in any field
have been replaced with spaces.

| line | fixed fields | free text (last) |
|---|---|---|
| `DCCORE HELLO 1.1 <botnick>` | protocol major.minor, nick | the version string |
| `DCCORE REQUEST <nick> <channel> <file\|folder>` | | the name |

| `DCCORE LOG <CATEGORY>` | JOIN, PART, QUIT, BAN, HARDBAN, MUTE, TBAN, INFO | the prose, as the plain console shows it |
| `DCCORE OUT` | | one line of a console command's reply |
| `DCCORE DROPPED <n>` | lines the bot had to drop for a slow client | |
| `DCCORE TAKEN <ip>` | the address that took the console over | |
| `DCCORE LISTFETCH <bot> <action>` | `auto` (asked again automatically), `arrived`, `unusable` | one line of prose that names the bot |
| `DCCORE FETCH <bot> <action>` | `asked`, `queued` (in that bot's queue), `receiving`, `done`, `failed` - a file the bot itself leeches from another bot, e.g. from the dashboard's Downloads page | one line of prose that names the bot and the file |
| `DCCORE STATUS <used> <slots> <qfiles> <qusers> <sent_today> <bytes_today> <bps_now> <record_bps> <started> <failed> <searches>` | slots in use / total, files and users queued, today's sends and bytes, speed now, the record; then when the bot started (epoch) and the failures and searches it has seen since | |
| `DCCORE SLOT <nick> <sent> <total> <bps>` | one per active transfer: bytes so far, size, speed from its own clock | the name |
| `DCCORE FETCHING <bot> <received> <total> <bps> <name>` | one per file the bot is receiving from another bot right now (#1019), in the status burst after the QUEUE lines - the panel's Downloading section. Sent only to a script that said it is 1.8 or later in `HELLO` | the name (a list shows as "<bot>'s file list") |
| `DCCORE DLBEGIN` / `DCCORE DLROW <id> <kind> <state> <bot> <received> <total> <bps> <when> <note> <name>` / `DCCORE DLEND <waiting_total> <complete_total> <failed_total>` | the Downloads window's snapshot (#1022): one `DLROW` per download - `kind` is `d` (coming in), `w` (waiting), `c` (finished) or `f` (failed, a rejected list included), at most 15 of each of the last two, `note` one token (why it waits, or how it ended), `when` the epoch a finished one ended. Whole or not sent; every 3 seconds at most and only when it changed, only after `downloads on`. Sent only to a script that said 1.10 or later in `HELLO` | the Downloads window |
| `DCCORE DQBEGIN` / `DCCORE DQROW <id> <kind> <state> <bot> <note> <name>` / `DCCORE DQEND <count>` | the Download queues window's snapshot (#1217), sent when `dlqueue` is asked: one `DQROW` per request that has not started - `kind` is `f` (file), `r` (a `!rar` folder) or `l` (a list), `state` is `pending`, `offered` or `queued`, `note` one token (why it waits), the name last and may hold spaces. Whole or not sent. Only to a script that said 1.15 or later in `HELLO` | the Download queues window |
| `DCCORE PACKING <nick> <done> <total> <elapsed> <folder>` | a folder is being packed into an archive (#1202): in the status burst and every 3 seconds between; `DCCORE PACKING end` once when it stops. `done` is the archive's size so far in bytes, `total` the folder's (0 until measured; rar compresses, so the two are a guide), the folder's name is last and may hold spaces. Sent only to a script that said it is 1.14 or later in `HELLO` | the user |
| `DCCORE REBUILD <phase> <folder_index> <folder_count> <files> <elapsed>` | a master-list rebuild is running, however it was started (#1024): in the status burst and every 5 seconds between; `DCCORE REBUILD end` once when it stops. The phase is `starting`, `scanning`, `writing`, `packing` or `publishing`. Sent only to a script that said it is 1.9 or later in `HELLO`. The background audio reading (#1182), once the rebuild has published or when `audioinfo` started it alone, comes the same way to a script of 1.12 or later: `DCCORE REBUILD reading <read> <to_read> <files_a_second> <elapsed>`, `finding 0 0 0 <elapsed>` while a reading started alone reads the list to find what to read, then `rewriting 0 0 0 <elapsed>` while it writes the lengths into the list | the phase |
| `DCCORE QUEUE <pos> <nick> <files> <frozen_secs_left>` | one per queued user, the first 20 in the order they are served: position, files waiting, seconds until a frozen queue is dropped (0 = not frozen) | |
| `DCCORE TOKEN <name>` | the reply to `pair` | the token, shown once |
| `DCCORE PING` | stands in for a status burst the bot could not compute in time; a client treats it as any other line and shows nothing | |
| `DCCORE CHAT <id> <channel> <nick>` | a DCCore Chat line said in one of the bot's channels: an id (its time in milliseconds, only ever going up - a client draws each id once), the channel, who said it (the bot's own nick for a line sent with `chat`; `*` for the bot's own remark, such as somebody hidden for flooding) | the text, stripped of colours |
| `DCCORE CHANNELS` | the channels the bot is in, which are the ones it chats in; sent after `HELLO`, in answer to `chat` alone, and again with a status burst whenever they have changed | the channels, space-separated |

After `HELLO` the bot also sends `CHANNELS` and then the last 50 `CHAT` lines it
holds, so a window that reconnects shows what it missed. They are kept in memory
only, and a restart forgets them. `CHAT` and `CHANNELS` are new line types, not
fields inserted into old ones, so they do not move the minor. An older script
shows them as they come, as it does any type it does not know.

`<channel>` is always exactly one token, straight after the nick: the channel
the request or search was made in - for a request by private message, the
channel its sender shares with the bot - or `-` when there is none (a resume,
or a transfer that no longer knows where it was asked for), so a client can
count on the position of everything after it and print nothing for `-`.

Whatever you did not tick in **Settings → Console feed** is not sent in either
mode. A session that never says `hello` is the console described above,
unchanged.

### The live picture

`STATUS`, then a `SLOT` line per transfer, then a `QUEUE` line per waiting
user, is one **burst**, and it is what a client's title bar and side panel are
drawn from. It arrives:

- right after `HELLO`, so the window is filled before the first event;
- after any event that moved a slot or the queue (`SENDING`, `SENT`, `FAIL`,
  `QUEUED`, `RESUMED`), so the picture never waits for the timer;
- every 30 seconds while the session is quiet. That is also the heartbeat: a
  client that has heard nothing for a minute or so knows the link is dead,
  not merely idle. The figures are read on a helper thread with a two-second
  deadline; if they are not in by then (a queue lock or a stats database held
  for that long by some slow disk operation) the bot sends `DCCORE PING`
  instead, so a busy-but-alive bot is still heard from, and the feed keeps
  flowing behind it. The burst follows once the figures can be read.

The timer fills silence only. A client that is behind is already receiving
lines, and a burst on top of a backlog would only push more of them off the
500-line outbox, so the writer drains what is queued before the timer speaks.
`bps_now` is the daemon's own live speed; a `SLOT` line's `bps` is that
transfer's bytes over its own elapsed time, and reads `0` for the first half
second. It is the speed the next-slot estimate reads too (the one `-que`,
`-stats` and Live Transfers show), so the two cannot disagree. Today's
figures are the rolled ones, the same the advert shows.

### Pairing: a credential that is not the password

A script has to log in without a person typing, which means a credential
stored on disk. That should not be the admin password: the same string opens
the dashboard, and a `.mrc` file is not where it belongs. So a script is
**paired** instead:

```
pair dccore.mrc 1.0
```

The bot mints a random token (43 characters), stores only its PBKDF2 hash in
`data/adminchat_tokens.json` under the client's name, and sends the token back
once - as `DCCORE TOKEN dccore.mrc <token>` on a structured session, as a
plain line otherwise. Paste it into the script's settings; it is not shown
again. From then on the script answers `Enter Your Password:` with the token
and is logged in exactly as with the password: the same hostmask check
first, the same three attempts, the same IP block.

**The script only sends the token to the bot it paired with.** It dials the
bot's nick by itself, and on Undernet anyone can take a nick while the bot is
away, so before answering `Enter Your Password:` it compares the host the nick
has now with the one the bot had when the token was stored (`bothost` in
`dccore.ini`, learned when the token arrives). A different host is not sent the
token: the window says so and the script stops reconnecting by itself. If the bot
really has moved, `/dccore trust` accepts its current host. A script paired
before this check learns the host the first time the bot's is known; if it is
not known yet (you share no channel with it) the token waits for `/dccore trust`.

The same check guards the password prompt in a chat the script opened by itself.
With no token to send (you never paired, ran `unpair`, or are pairing while the
bot is away) the script used to put "Type the admin password here" in the window
for whoever held the nick. Now a chat you opened yourself with `/dccore connect`
or `/dccore pair` asks as before - that is your own act - but one the script
dialled after a JOIN, an IRC connect or a retry asks only if the nick is at the
host the bot is known to have (`bothost`); otherwise the window says so and the
script stops reconnecting until you `/dccore connect`. A script with no
`bothost` yet learns the host the first time it is known, as for the token.

What a token does **not** do is open the dashboard, or change the bot's
settings. The web login checks the admin password hash and nothing else - the
token store is never read there. In the console, a session that logged in
with a token can read the settings, the served lists, the folders and the
bans, and drive the feed and the queue commands as before; changing a
setting, the lists, the folders or the on-connect commands, reading or
resending the on-connect commands (an X login among them holds a password),
and pairing or revoking another script need the password, once per session:
`unlock <password>` (see "Settings over the console"). A stolen token still
costs you a console session, and one `unpair` ends it. For `dccore.mrc` the file that holds it is
`dccore.ini` beside the script, and it is clear text: mIRC's hash-table save
writes the token readable. The `.mrc` itself carries nothing. Keep `dccore.ini`
as you would a password file - a copied mIRC folder or a shared PC is where it
travels - and `/dccore unpair` the moment you think it has. Pairing the same name again replaces the old token -
which is why the script does not pair as the literal `dccore.mrc`: it pairs as
`dccore.mrc-<8 hex>`, the tail derived from the mIRC folder it is loaded from,
so a second machine (or a second mIRC on the same one) gets a name and a token
of its own instead of silently revoking the first. The same copy pairing again
still replaces its own token, which is how a lost one is rotated.

The web login also refuses a password sent by a page on another site: a
browser names the sending page in the `Origin` (or `Referer`) header, and when
that is not the address the dashboard was opened at, the attempt is answered
403 and not counted. Without this, any website open in the same browser could
post three wrong passwords to `127.0.0.1:8420` and lock you out of your own
dashboard for fifteen minutes, again and again. If you reach the dashboard
through a reverse proxy, the proxy must pass the `Host` header through
unchanged (`proxy_set_header Host $host;` in nginx), or every login is refused
with "This login was sent by another site".

```
unpair                    list the paired clients and when they were paired
unpair dccore.mrc-3f9a12c0   revoke one; its next login is a wrong password
```

`pair` and `unpair` are console commands: you have to be logged in - with
the password or with a token - to mint or revoke one. The file lives where
**Settings → Advanced → Paired console scripts file** points.

## Settings over the console

The commands `settings`, `set`, `setbegin`, `setcommit`, `setabort`,
`setpreview`, `served`, `folders`, `onconnect`, `banlist` and `consolecaps`
(#1264) give the console what the dashboard's Settings page has, for
`dccore.mrc`'s settings window and for a person at a plain console. Each one
runs the dashboard's own code - the same list of settings, the same checks,
the same save, the same rehash - so the console can never accept a value the
page would refuse, or the other way round.

**Settings changes need the admin password, not only a paired token.** A
session that logged in with the password can do all of it. One that logged in
with a paired token - kept in clear text in `dccore.ini` - can read `settings`,
`served`, `folders`, `banlist`, `setpreview` and `consolecaps`, and buffer
`set` lines in a transaction, but is answered `DCCORE LOCKED <command>` for
`setcommit`, a lone `set`, `served commit`, `folders commit`, `onconnect commit`,
`onconnect resend`, the `onconnect` listing itself (an X login holds a
password), `pair`, and `unpair` of anything but its own token - until
`unlock <password>` succeeds once in that session. A refused commit leaves its
transaction open, so the window can ask for the password, unlock, and send the
commit again. The dashboard's own Console is behind the dashboard login, which
is the password, and is never locked.

They are console commands only. The admin commands typed in a channel are a
fixed handful (`!rehash`, `!update`, `!ban`, `!unban`, `!clearqueue`) and never
reach them. The dashboard's own Console page can run `settings`, `set`,
`setpreview` and the listings, but not a transaction: it forgets everything
between commands, so `setbegin` there would be gone before the first `set` -
which would then save at once. It says so instead.

A plain session gets sentences; a structured one (after `hello`) gets the
lines below. Whatever the bot's log shows of these commands, it is never a
value: it shows the command word, and the subcommand when it is a real one
(`served begin`), never the rest of the line - not even after a typo; the rows
of a transaction are not logged at all, and a commit logs the names of what it
saved. A line may be up to 32768 characters once logged in (a `served folder`
row with the longest label and path the dashboard allows fits), 4096 before.

### The value encoding

A value crosses in **one line, in its `settings.conf` form**: `true`/`false`
for a switch, a number as written in the file (sizes in bytes, as stored - the
dashboard only divides them for display), a list as its entries joined by
`, `, a `CUSTOM_THEME_*` colour as its `\x03`-style escape text (exactly what
the Settings page shows), and nothing at all for an empty value. A value that
is the **last field** of its line is the rest of the line. Into that, exactly
these characters are written as `%HH`, two hex digits of the character:

- a control character, `%00`-`%1F` and `%7F`;
- a space at the start or the end of the value, and every space that follows
  another space, as `%20`;
- a `%` that would otherwise read as one of these escapes, as `%25`.

Those are the only escapes there are - `%00`-`%1F`, `%20`, `%25`, `%2D`, `%7F`,
in either case - so `%admin%`, `%nick%` and `100%` cross as they are. An
ordinary value is sent unchanged, and nothing on a line depends on a run of
spaces surviving the trip (mIRC collapses them). To decode, replace every
escape with its character in one pass, left to right (`%2520` is `%20`, not a
space); in mIRC, `$regsubex(%v,/%(0[0-9a-f]|1[0-9a-f]|2[05d]|7f)/gi,$chr($base(\1,16,10)))`.
Encode what you send back the same way. An empty value is a line that ends
after the field before it: `set DEBUG_CHANNEL` clears the debug channel.

A value that is **not** the last field (a folder's label, a channel) must stay
one word, so it is a *token*: the same encoding with every space written as
`%20`, `-` for an empty value, and `%2D` for a value that is exactly `-`.

Fields are separated by the ASCII space only. Any other whitespace - a
no-break space, U+3000, a tab escaped as `%09` - is part of the value, so a
label like `My Music` written with a no-break space comes back as it went.
Lines are UTF-8.

### Machine-readable output

Every snapshot is framed like the Download queues window's (`DQBEGIN` ...
`DQEND`): a `...BEGIN` line, the rows, a `...END` line, both carrying the
counts. A snapshot is queued without dropping a line: the bot waits for the
session's 500-line outbox to have room rather than letting it drop the
snapshot's first lines, keeping 100 lines free for the live feed. A client
that takes nothing for 15 seconds is not waited for: the snapshot stops there,
with a `DCCORE OUT` line saying so and no `...END`. So a client still checks
that it received the `...BEGIN`, the `...END` and as many rows as their counts
say before it lets anyone edit them - a page edited from half a snapshot would
save half a configuration. A
transaction's rows mirror its snapshot's rows word for word (`DCCORE SRVLIST`
becomes `served list`, and so on), so a page sent back untouched is the
snapshot's own lines, and saves nothing.

A transaction replies to its rows only when one is refused; its commit always
ends with exactly one `...DONE` line, after any `...ERR` lines. A row that was
refused makes the commit save nothing. `...DONE` carries its status as the
first field, and its last field is always a sentence to show.

| line | when | fields |
|---|---|---|
| `DCCORE CAPS <name>:<version> ... machine:<name>` | `consolecaps` | today `settings:1 preview:1 served:1 folders:1 onconnect:1 banlist:1 unlock:1`, then `machine:` and this computer's name (spaces and colons as `-`), which a client compares with its own to know whether the bot is on the same machine - the console's address cannot tell, since a DCC chat to a bot on the same PC arrives from the public address. A bot without these commands answers `DCCORE OUT Unknown command: consolecaps. Type 'help'.` - say "update the bot" then. A version goes up when a field of that part moves; a part added later is a new name |
| `DCCORE SETBEGIN <n>` / `DCCORE SETF <KEY> <type> <value>` / `DCCORE SETEND <n>` | `settings [<word>]` | one `SETF` per setting, in the Settings page's order; `type` is `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or `list`, the value last (empty: the line ends after the type - for `WEBUI_CONSOLE_ENABLED` that means "not set"). `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is never among them. Labels, help, units and choices are the dashboard's metadata, not sent here |
| `DCCORE LOCKED <command> <sentence>` | any of the commands above that change something, on a session that logged in with a token and has not unlocked | `command` is what was refused, one or two words (`setcommit`, `set`, `served commit`, `folders commit`, `onconnect commit`, `onconnect resend`, `onconnect`, `pair`, `unpair`); the sentence says to unlock. Nothing was saved; an open transaction stays open |
| `DCCORE UNLOCKED` | `unlock <password>` | the session may change settings now (also the answer when it already could) |
| `DCCORE UNLOCK error <message>` | `unlock` with a wrong password | still locked; the third wrong one closes the session instead |
| `DCCORE SETOPEN <dropped>` | `setbegin` | `dropped`: changes buffered by a transaction that was still open, now gone (0 normally) |
| `DCCORE SETERR <KEY> <message>` | `set` refused | the Settings page's reason. `KEY` is the name as sent, uppercased |
| `DCCORE SETDONE ok <written> <unchanged> <restart> <message>` | `setcommit`, or `set` outside a transaction | saved in one call, rehash started; `unchanged` counts the values equal to the current ones - what `settings.conf` holds for the setting, or the running value when the file does not set it - not written; `restart` is the comma-separated settings that need a restart of the bot (`WEBUI_*`, `SERVER`, `PORT`), or `-` |
| `DCCORE SETDONE error <message>` | | nothing was saved; the transaction is closed |
| `DCCORE SETDONE confirm <question>` | | the commit clears `DEBUG_CHANNEL`, and the bot leaves that channel at once: ask, then send `setcommit confirm` (or `setabort`). A transaction from `setbegin` stays open meanwhile. After a lone `set` the question holds only until the next line: anything but `setcommit confirm` or `setabort` first ends it with `SETDONE aborted <n>`, and is then run as usual - so a later lone `set` saves at once, as it says |
| `DCCORE SETDONE aborted <n>` | `setabort` | `n` buffered changes dropped |
| `DCCORE SETAPPLIED` | after `SETDONE ok` with something written | the save's rehash has finished, so the new values are in effect - reload the page now, not at `SETDONE`: the rehash first waits up to `REHASH_TRANSFER_WAIT` for transfers, and until it reloads, `settings` still shows the old values. Always after the `SETDONE ok` it belongs to; none for a save that wrote nothing or failed |
| `DCCORE PVBEGIN 2` / `DCCORE PVLINE <advert\|notice> <line>` / `DCCORE PVEND 2` | `setpreview` | the sample advert and transfer notice, encoded like every other value - colour codes as `%03`, runs of spaces as `%20` - so a client decodes it and echoes it in colour. (mIRC collapses runs of spaces in a chat line, and a theme's frame is made of them.) |
| `DCCORE SRVBEGIN <lists> <source> <max>` / `DCCORE SRVLIST <n> <primary> <name>` / `DCCORE SRVCHAN <n> <channel> <mode>` / `DCCORE SRVFOLDER <n> <label> <path>` / `DCCORE SRVEND <lists> <channels> <folders>` | `served` | per list, in order: its `SRVLIST` (`n` from 1, `primary` `1` or `0`, the name last), then a `SRVCHAN` per channel bound to it (`channel` a token, `mode` `normal`, `quiet` or `request_only`), then a `SRVFOLDER` per folder (`label` a token, the path last). `source` is `file` (`lists.json`) or `implied` (none: one list over the served folders - sending it back unchanged does not create the file). `max` is how many lists there may be |
| `DCCORE SRVOPEN <dropped>` | `served begin` | then `served list <n> <0\|1> <name>` (`n` the next number), `served chan <n> <channel> <mode>`, `served folder <n> <label> <path>`, and `served commit` or `served abort` |
| `DCCORE SRVERR <message>` | a row refused, or one problem of a refused set | |
| `DCCORE SRVDONE ok <lists> <message>` / `DCCORE SRVDONE unchanged <message>` / `DCCORE SRVDONE error <message>` / `DCCORE SRVDONE aborted <n>` | `served commit` / `served abort` | `ok`: written, and the lists need a rebuild to be published. An empty set (`served begin` then `served commit`) goes back to one list over the served folders |
| `DCCORE FLDBEGIN <n> <source>` / `DCCORE FLDROW <n> <label> <path>` / `DCCORE FLDEND <n>` | `folders` | `source` is `file`, `file_directory` (the one `FILE_DIRECTORY`) or `none`; `label` a token, the path last |
| `DCCORE FLDOPEN <dropped>` | `folders begin` | then `folders row <n> <label> <path>`, and `folders commit` or `folders abort` |
| `DCCORE FLDERR <message>` / `DCCORE FLDDONE ok <n> <message>` / `DCCORE FLDDONE unchanged <message>` / `DCCORE FLDDONE error <message>` / `DCCORE FLDDONE aborted <n>` | | as for `served`. An empty set goes back to the single `FILE_DIRECTORY` |
| `DCCORE OCBEGIN <n> <delay> <max_commands> <max_delay>` / `DCCORE OCLINE <n> <command>` / `DCCORE OCEND <n>` | `onconnect` | the commands in the order they are sent, the seconds between them, and the two limits. A command is shown whole - it may be an X login with its password, which is why it is never logged |
| `DCCORE OCOPEN <dropped>` | `onconnect begin` | then `onconnect delay <seconds>` (unsent: the saved delay is kept), `onconnect line <n> <command>`, and `onconnect commit` or `onconnect abort`. An empty set clears them |
| `DCCORE OCERR <message>` / `DCCORE OCDONE ok <n> <message>` / `DCCORE OCDONE unchanged <message>` / `DCCORE OCDONE error <message>` / `DCCORE OCDONE aborted <n>` | | as for `served`; a problem names the command by its number, never by its text. Saved commands go out at the next connect, or now with `onconnect resend` |
| `DCCORE OCRESEND ok <sent> <message>` / `DCCORE OCRESEND error <message>` | `onconnect resend` | the dashboard's Resend button |
| `DCCORE BANBEGIN <permanent> <timed>` / `DCCORE BANP <pattern>` / `DCCORE BANT <seconds_left> <nick>` / `DCCORE BANEND <permanent> <timed>` | `banlist` | the permanent wildcard patterns (`hard_bans.txt`), then every timed ban or ignore still running - the bot keeps the two in one table, so it cannot say which a timed one is. At most 200 rows of each kind; the counts are the true totals. Change them with `ban` / `unban <pattern>` and `ignore <nick> <minutes>` / `unignore <nick>`; `ban` and `unban` run in the background and report with a `LOG` line, so ask `banlist` again after it |

Every free-text value here is encoded as above, the preview lines too, and
every message is plain text.

## The window, in mIRC

`scripts/mirc/dccore.mrc` is the client the feed above was designed for:
the bot's whole life in one mIRC window, so that running DCCore feels no
different from running a script inside mIRC. It needs **mIRC 6.10 or
later** - everything it uses dates from mIRC 6.x - and a bot that answers
`hello`: the DCCore this script ships with, or a later one. On an older bot
it still works as a plain console, without the panel.

### First time

Save the file anywhere (your mIRC folder is fine) and, in mIRC:

```
/load -rs dccore.mrc
/dccore pair MusicBot
```

with your bot's nick in place of `MusicBot`. The `@DCCore` window opens,
the chat is offered exactly as `/dcc chat` would (path 1 or 2 above, as
the bot decides), and when the bot asks for the password you **type it in
the window, once**. The script then sends `pair dccore.mrc-<id> 1.1` - the
id is this mIRC install's own, see "What a token does not do" above - keeps the
token the bot answers with in `dccore.ini` beside the script (in clear
text - see "What a token does not do" above), and from then on connects
and logs in without you: on `/dccore connect`, when mIRC connects to IRC,
and whenever the bot's nick joins a channel you share. The token opens the
console and nothing else: changing settings asks for the password once in the
session (`unlock`). The password never touches the disk.

If your client cannot be dialled and the bot offers the chat back (path
2), mIRC shows its usual incoming-chat dialog the first time - accept it,
or add the bot with `/dcc trust <botnick>` and set **Options → DCC → On
Chat request** to auto-accept so it never asks again.

The `[STATUS]` line, joins, parts and bans do not light it, as they would not in a channel. mIRC 7 or later |
| a beep | on a failed transfer, if you leave that on |

Without the side panel, a `[STATUS]` line summarises the numbers in the
text every five minutes, so they are somewhere to see. With the panel on
there is none: the panel shows the same figures, live. A bot that goes quiet for
90 seconds is treated as gone and the chat is reopened; a chat that
cannot be opened is retried after 5 s, 15 s, 60 s and then every two
minutes. An offer the bot never answers - mIRC's own `Waiting for
acknowledgement...` never gives up - is closed after 75 seconds and
retried the same way. Closing the window closes the chat and stops the
retries; `/dccore connect` starts them again.

When mIRC starts, `@DCCore` opens by itself, minimised, with its button at
the end of the switchbar (dccore.mrc 1.13 or later). Until the console
connects, its title and first line say what it is waiting for: mIRC not
connected to the bot's network yet, the bot not answering yet, the console
not open (you closed the window last time, so it waits for
`/dccore connect`), or no bot paired yet, with the command to pair one.
Opening it does not dial the bot: the usual reconnect when mIRC connects to
the bot's network fills it in. Closing the window does not stop it opening next time; the setting under
**Open when mIRC starts** in the options does. DCCore Chat and the Downloads
window can open the same way; both are off by default.

### Options

`/dccore options` (or right-click → Script Settings):

- a tickbox and a colour for each kind of event - requests, queue
  positions, sends, failures, searches, joins/parts/quits, bans, other log
  lines - plus the colour of file names, of console replies and of the side
  panel's headings, and how
  often the `[STATUS]` line is written when the side panel is off (0 = never);
- under those, the colours inside a line (dccore.mrc 1.18 or later): **Search
  text** (the searched term; *same as File names* until you choose), **Nicks** and
  **Channels** (both *same as the line*, no colour of their own, until you choose).
  **Nicks** can also be *per nick*: each nick gets a colour of its own from its
  name, the same every time whatever its case, out of the colours that can be
  read on the window's background. A new choice colours new lines; what is
  already in the window stays as it was drawn;
- the side panel, the title bar figures, console replies in a separate
  window, the beep, the fixed-width font and its size (the Status window's
  size until you set one - on a high-resolution screen you may want a
  bigger number), and the window's background colour (one of mIRC's sixteen,
  or "none" to leave the window as mIRC has it). mIRC has no per-window
  colour setting, so the script writes a one-pixel picture of the colour
  beside itself (`dccore-bg-<n>.bmp`) and tiles it behind the text;
- the bot's nick, whether the script reconnects by itself, the pairing
  state with **Pair again...** and **Forget token**.
- **Open when mIRC starts (minimised)**: `@DCCore` (on by default),
  `@DCCore-Chat` and `@DCCore-Downloads` (both off by default).

These are the script's own filters, kept by mIRC in `dccore.ini`. The
bot's **Settings → Console feed** tickboxes remain the ceiling on what is
sent at all: what is off there never reaches the script.

### The bot's settings

`/dccore settings` (or right-click -> **Bot Settings**, or **Settings...** next to
**Options...** in the other menus) opens the settings window (dccore.mrc 1.19 or
later, mIRC 6.17 or later): the bot's own settings, as the dashboard's Settings
page has them, over the console commands above. Six tabs - **General**,
**Sharing**, **Downloads**, **Security**, **Dashboard & Console**, **Advanced** -
each with its pages as a column of buttons on the left, and **Apply**, **OK** and **Cancel**
at the bottom.

- **The labels, units, choices and help are the dashboard's.** Point at a
  setting and its help shows under the page. Sizes show in KB or MB and go back
  in bytes, as on the dashboard.
- **General Settings** gathers the switches used most, including four of this
  mIRC's own: open @DCCore, Chat and Downloads when mIRC starts, and reconnect
  to the bot by itself. Those are saved here, in `dccore.ini`, by Apply or OK.
- **Apply** sends what changed - only that - as one transaction (`setbegin`, a
  `set` for each, `setcommit`), so the bot saves it in one go and rehashes once.
  A value the bot refuses comes back with the dashboard's reason in the status
  line, the window shows the page it is on, and nothing is saved; your edits
  stay. Clearing the debug channel asks first, as the dashboard does. A change
  on **File locations** asks before it is sent. **OK** is Apply, then closes once
  the bot has saved; **Cancel** closes and sends nothing.
- **Structured pages** save with buttons of their own: the on-connect commands
  on **IRC Server** (and **Resend now**), the served lists, their folders and
  each channel's list and mode on **Lists & channels** (rows such as
  `#music -> Main - Normal`; select one to edit it, then **Save lists**), and
  **Bans & ignores** (lift a timed ban, ignore a nick for some minutes, add or
  remove a permanent pattern). **Channels** edits `CHANNEL` as a list and is
  saved by Apply. A save the bot refuses keeps your edits there. A row or a
  command you did not touch goes back exactly as the bot sent it.
- **Appearance**: the theme and the six custom colours as menus of mIRC's
  sixteen. **Preview** draws the sample advert and notice, with the colours as
  chosen and not saved, in `@DCCore-preview`.
- **This mIRC window** opens the old **Options** dialog - `/dccore options` is
  still that one.
- **Paths** are the bot's. The **...** buttons that browse for one work only when
  the bot runs on this PC - the console connection is 127.0.0.1, or the computer
  name the bot reports (`machine:` in its `CAPS` line) is this one's; otherwise
  type the path as it is on the bot's machine.
- **A bot without these commands** answers `consolecaps` with "Unknown command",
  and the window says to update the bot; only this mIRC's own switches can be
  changed then. A snapshot that arrives cut short (the counts on its BEGIN and
  END lines disagree, or the END never comes) is never shown half: press
  **Reload** or **Refresh**.

The dialog is generated: `scripts/mirc/build_settings_window.py` writes it into
a marked block of `dccore.mrc` from the bot's own settings metadata and
`scripts/mirc/settings_window_layout.py` (which setting is on which page). A
setting added to the bot fails a test until it has a place in the window, or a
reason not to; run the script after changing either, and `--check` says
whether the block is up to date.

### DCCore Chat: talking to other operators

A second window, **DCCore Chat**, for chatting with other operators in the
channels your bot is in. **Your bot is the relay.** What you type goes to the
bot over this console, and the bot says it in the channels where it has seen
other DCCore bots, as an ordinary channel message (never a NOTICE: channel
bots kick for those). A chat line another DCCore bot sends in one of the
bot's channels comes back to your window. Your own mIRC does not have to be
in any channel.

It is **public**. A channel message reaches everyone in it, whether or
not they run this script. Your lines show as said by your bot. The window's
title and its first lines say so.

- **Opening it:** right-click in a channel → *DCCore Chat*, or in `@DCCore` → *Window* → *DCCore Chat*,
  or `/dccore chat`. It also opens by itself (minimised, its button lit)
  when a chat line arrives, unless you turn that off in `/dccore options`.
- **Talking:** type in the window. By default the line is said once in the
  fewest channels (at most 5) that reach every other DCCore bot seen, and in
  no channel without one (`chat * <text>`). Right-click → *Send to* picks one
  channel instead, and that channel is listened on too. `/dccore chat <text>`
  does the same from anywhere. What you type goes on the bot's express lane,
  so it is not held up behind a line for each of its other channels. With
  nothing picked, an answer goes where the conversation is: privately to a
  peer who wrote to you privately, or to the channel the last line you see
  came from. A private conversation is never moved to a channel by itself -
  only a pick does that.
- **Listening:** every channel the bot is in, by default. Only lines from
  other DCCore bots arrive at all, so there is little to filter. Untick
  *Listen on all the bot's channels* (right-click, or `/dccore options`) and
  tick the ones you want under *Listen on* instead. Your own lines always
  show.
- **Reconnecting:** the bot keeps the last 50 lines in memory, and a window
  that reconnects shows what it missed, each line once, with the time it
  was said. A bot restart forgets them.

**Who is another DCCore bot:** every DCCore bot registers with a realname whose
first word is `DCCore/sc` (then its nick). The bot asks `WHO` for each of its
channels at start and about every ten minutes (`chat who` asks at once,
`chat peers` lists who answered) and remembers the nicks with that realname.
Nothing is sent to them; WHO is answered by the server. A peer that leaves,
quits or changes nick is forgotten. Anyone can write that realname, so it is
a filter and not proof.

A chat line is a channel message whose first word is `[ServersChat]`, **from
one of those peers**. The bots' own adverts and search replies carry the
realname too, and never the tag. The tag is neutral so that a script that is
not DCCore's can speak it too. The bot takes only those, and only in its own
channels, and:

- **never answers a message by itself, and never sends a received line
  on**, so two bots cannot echo each other. Every line it sends is one an
  operator typed;
- **limits each sender:** more than 5 lines in 10 seconds from one nick
  hides that nick for 60 seconds, said once in the window. **Everyone
  together** is limited too: past 30 lines in 10 seconds the rest are
  dropped, said once;
- **takes nothing from a nick you have banned;**
- **limits what you send:** 6 channel lines a minute, so chat never holds up
  the queue's own messages. A line said in three channels counts three;
- **strips colours, control codes and the characters that reverse the
  direction text is drawn in**, both ways;
- **never writes a chat line to disk or to the debug channel.**

The tag proves nothing about the sender. Anyone can type it, and the nick
shown is whoever the server says sent the line.

If your own mIRC is in the channel too, the raw tagged message is kept out of the
channel window while the bot relays it, so you don't see every line twice.
With the chat to the bot down, it shows in the channel as usual, so nothing
is lost.

### Updating the script

A newer bot may send a line with a field the loaded script does not know
about. Save the new `dccore.mrc` over the old one, then in mIRC:

```
/reload -rs dccore.mrc
/dccore connect
```

`/reload` re-reads the file in place and keeps your settings and the stored
token (they live in `dccore.ini` beside it); `/load` would add a second copy.
The window says so itself when the two sides disagree: *"speaks feed 1.2 and
this script was written for 1.1"* means update the script; the same line the
other way round means update the bot. The bot checks in the other direction
too: a script older than the one its lines were written for is told
*"Update the script"* right after `hello`.

### If something is off

- **Channel names or nonsense numbers where the position, slot or size
  should be** - the bot and the script disagree on where a field sits; the
  script and the bot ship together, and one of them is older. The window
  says which when it connects (see "Updating the script" above). A script
  from before the channel field was added does not say so: it just shows
  the channel as the next number - update it.
- **Non-ASCII file names look garbled** - mIRC 6 shows text in your
  Windows code page and the bot sends UTF-8. mIRC 7 decodes the chat as
  UTF-8 and shows them correctly; the script is the same file on both.
- **"Plain mode" in the window** - the bot is from before `hello` and
  does not answer it; the window shows the chat as it comes, with no
  panel. Or the bot speaks a newer protocol than the script - a script
  from before the version carried a minor refuses `1.1` this way and says
  "Update the script": do that (see "Updating the script" above).
- **The stored token is refused** - it was revoked on the bot (`unpair`),
  replaced by pairing the same name again (the same mIRC install; another
  machine pairs under its own name and leaves this one alone), or the token
  file was moved; `/dccore pair` again, typing the password once. The script does
  not send a refused token again and does not redial by itself until you
  log in or pair again: a refusal counts as a wrong password, three of them
  block your address for 15 minutes, and left to itself the redial would
  reach that in about two minutes.
- **You are on more than one network** - the script remembers which
  network the bot is on from the moment you type `/dccore connect` or
  `/dccore pair` there (or from the bot's own join), and every later dial -
  on connect, on the bot's join, on a retry, or `/dccore connect` typed in
  a window on another network - goes to that network. Pairing again from
  another network moves it. `/dccore version` says which network it holds.
- **Two people with the script** - the console is one session, and a
  login replaces the one before it. The client that was replaced says so
  and does not reconnect by itself, so the two of you take turns rather
  than trading it every few seconds.
- **"No answer from <bot> in 75 seconds"** - the bot got the offer and
  said nothing back. It refuses in silence when your host is not in
  `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS`, when your address is blocked for 15 minutes after
  three wrong passwords, or when it could not reach your client and its
  own offer back was dropped (see `ADMIN_CHAT_MODE`); the bot's own log
  says which. The script keeps retrying with the usual backoff.

## Limits and timeouts

| | |
|---|---|
| Time to enter the password | 60 seconds, then the socket closes |
| Password attempts | 3, then the socket closes and your IP is blocked |
| IP block after failed attempts | 15 minutes |
| Idle timeout once logged in | none — the console stays open until you close it, log in again from elsewhere, or the connection drops |
| Sessions at once | 1 |
| Lines queued for a slow client | 500, then the oldest are dropped (a structured session is told how many) |
| Structured status burst | every 30 seconds while quiet, and after any slot or queue change |

**A second login replaces the first.** If you left a session open on another
machine, or your client froze and the server has not timed the nick out yet, just
connect again — the old session is told it was taken over and closed. The
replacement happens only *after* the new session authenticates, so nobody who
merely matches the host can drop your live console without the password.

---

## When it does not work

**The bot ignores you completely — no reply, nothing.**
This is by design: an unrecognised host gets no answer at all, so a stranger
cannot learn whether they guessed the mask correctly. It also means a wrong mask
looks identical to a broken bot. Check the daemon log:

```
[ADMINCHAT] Ignored DCC CHAT from unauthorised host: cpe-198-51-100-7.isp.net
```

That line tells you the host the server actually saw. Usually it means `+x` is not
set, or `ADMIN_HOSTMASKS` has a typo - or was never set at all: `configure.py`'s
services-host question is optional, and an install where it was left blank at
setup is still missing step 3.

**The log says the password is not set.**

```
[ADMINCHAT] DCC CHAT from an authorised host refused: ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH is not set.
```

Step 2 was skipped, or the value did not reach `admin_config.py`. A console with
no password refuses everyone rather than letting anyone in.

**The log says the connection to you timed out.**

```
[ADMINCHAT] Could not connect to operator at 203.0.113.41:55101 (timed out);
falling back to listening.
```

A **timeout** rather than a refusal means the packets left and nothing came back:
the address your client advertised is not reachable from the daemon. Usual
causes, most likely first:

1. **A VPN.** Your client reports the VPN's exit address, but inbound
   connections to it are not forwarded back to you.
2. A router not forwarding the port to your machine.
3. A firewall that drops rather than rejects.
4. The daemon's own outbound blocked to high ports.

A port-checker saying "open" is weaker evidence than it looks: your client's DCC
listener exists only while a request is pending, so a check run at any other
moment is testing something else — usually a forwarding rule rather than a live
listener.

You do not have to work out which it is. Set `ADMIN_CHAT_MODE = "listen"` and the
bot stops dialling you altogether. The listener it opens answers only a connection
from the address your client advertised in its CTCP - or, when the address you
advertised is the bot's own public one, from a private-network address (#881): if
you and the bot share one home router, your client advertises that router's public
IP, but your own connection can arrive at the bot with a private LAN address
instead (a NAT hairpin), which the exact match alone would reject as a stranger.
Only then: a private address when you are somewhere else is a neighbour on a
shared network, or a proxy's own address, not you. Anything else that reaches the
port during the window is dropped without a banner, logged as
`Dropped a connection from <ip> ... Still waiting.`, and the port stays open for
you. (A passive request advertises no address, so there the first connection is
taken.)

**The log says it could not connect to you at `0.0.0.0`.**

```
[ADMINCHAT] Could not connect to operator at 0.0.0.0:11283 ([Errno 111] Connection refused).
```

Your client did not know its own address and offered `0.0.0.0`. That is not a
harmless blank: on Linux, connecting to `0.0.0.0` means "this host", so the
daemon dialled *itself* and found nothing listening. Newer builds detect this and
fall back to listening on the DCC port range instead, so it should now just work.
Fix it properly in mIRC under **Options → Connect → Local Info** as above.

**The log says "Unusable DCC CHAT offer".**

```
[ADMINCHAT] Unusable DCC CHAT offer from operator: 'DCC CHAT chat 3405803861 0 350'
```

That particular one was a parser bug, now fixed — the offer above is a valid
passive request (`0` for the port, `350` as the token) and is handled. If you
still see this line, the text after the colon is what the client actually sent;
anything that is not `DCC CHAT chat <ip> <port>` or `DCC CHAT chat <ip> 0
<token>` is genuinely unusable.

**"No free port in 55000-55010 for the console."**
Every port in the range is busy with transfers. Wait for one to finish, or widen
`DCC_PORT_START`/`DCC_PORT_END` — remembering to forward the wider range too.

**"address is temporarily blocked."**
Three wrong passwords from that IP. Wait 15 minutes, or restart the daemon — the
block lives in memory only.

**Locked out entirely.**
Edit `admin_config.py` and restart. While `ADMIN_CHANNEL_COMMANDS` is on (it
ships on), the channel commands still work, so you are never without a way in.

---

## What this does and does not protect

**Protects against:** someone taking your nick while you are offline; a hostmask
alone without the password; a stolen password used from the wrong host; brute
force, via the attempt limit and the IP block.

**Does not protect against:** anyone who has compromised your Undernet X account
*and* knows the password. The DCC CHAT connection is plaintext, so the password
crosses the wire in clear — the host check is the real gate, and the password is
depth behind it. Optional TLS is on the list for a later phase.

---

## Coming next

Optional, and not built: TLS on the chat (Python's `ssl` is stdlib, and iroffer
supports it), and iroffer's second restricted admin tier (`hadminhost`).
