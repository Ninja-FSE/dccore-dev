    # the IRC read thread, which calls this once per denied PRIVMSG. The queue is bounded
    # (deque maxlen), so a flood of alerts drops the oldest lines instead of growing without
    # limit or stalling the daemon. sendall() in the drain replaces send(), whose return

    # publishing the daemon's internals to a channel other people can sit in.

    # console is attached, the line would simply cease to exist - and the moment
    # that is most likely is exactly when something has gone wrong and nobody is
    # connected. So when nothing took it, it goes to stdout, which the LXC
    # console and the journal always have. Only then: printing every line
    # unconditionally would double up on the 44 call sites that already log.
