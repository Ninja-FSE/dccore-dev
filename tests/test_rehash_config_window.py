"""A rehash must never show a running daemon a configuration it does not have.

WHAT WENT WRONG

Two defects, one report, both in the rehash path.

1. THE RELOAD WINDOW. `importlib.reload(defaults)` re-executes defaults.py from
   the top. That file is a long list of literal assignments - NICKNAME = None,
   CHANNEL = None, ADMIN_NICK = None - and `settings_file.apply_to(globals())`
   runs only at the very end of it. So for the whole of a reload, every setting
   the operator configured is transiently back to its shipped default.

   Measured against a real install's settings.conf: a thread looping on
   config.NICKNAME during the reload saw it blank for 52% of the window.

   An operator saved DEBUG_CHANNEL from the dashboard. The browser re-fetched
   /api/settings the moment the response said "Rehash started", landed inside
   the window, and the Settings page came back with Nickname, Admin nick(s) and
   Channels EMPTY - on a daemon whose settings.conf had all three, intact, the
   entire time. Only those three looked wrong because every other setting on
   that page has a shipped default that happens to match what most operators
   run, so it renders identically either way.

2. THE DEBUG CHANNEL WAS NEVER JOINED. The rehash's channel sync built its
   list from CHANNEL alone; DEBUG_CHANNEL appeared in that block only in the
   test that stops it being PARTed. irc.py joins it at connect and nothing
   joins it after that. So setting a debug channel on a running bot reported
   success and did nothing until the next restart.

Both share the signature that keeps costing this project real installs:
NOTHING FAILED. No exception, no error line, no failing test - just a page
telling the truth about a state that should never have been observable, and a
JOIN that was never sent.
