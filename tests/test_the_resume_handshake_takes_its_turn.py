"""The DCC ACCEPT reply went straight onto the IRC socket.

Every other thing the bot says waits for a slot on `runtime.outbound_pacer` -
the shared clock that exists because this bot has been disconnected with
"Excess Flood" in production. `!ping` was one exception and is fixed; the
`DCC ACCEPT` that answers a peer's resume request is the other (#453).

It is not queued behind the round-robin. A resume handshake is something a
peer is actively waiting on, so it stays immediate; what changes is that it
takes a slot on the same clock instead of ignoring it. The wait is only paid
when the bot has just sent something else, and is at most MSG_DELAY.
