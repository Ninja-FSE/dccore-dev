"""A transfer is complete when the receiver says it has all of it.

Found by a second operator running DCCore on Windows, reproduced with mIRC
(#526). The channel announced a 2.7 MB list zip as sent - counted, credited,
"Speed: n/a (<1s)" - eleven seconds after the receiver had reported it
incomplete at 1.2 MB after 24 seconds.

The DCC SEND protocol has the receiver send back a 4-byte big-endian running
total after every packet: the ONLY signal of what actually arrived. The send
loop never read it. "Complete" was `bytes_sent >= file_size`, where bytes_sent
counted what sendall() had handed to the kernel - and the kernel's send buffer
is 4 MB on Windows by default, bigger than most files. So the bot declared
success at t~0, stopped its clock (a memcpy's speed), counted the file, slept
1.5 seconds and closed the socket with megabytes still queued behind a link
doing 50 KB/s.

These tests play the receiver over a real loopback socket, with real acks -
including one that acks slowly, one that stops acking mid-file, one that says
nothing at all, and one that resumes - and check what the bot concludes.
