"""The notices badge: the short list of things the operator should be told.

DCCore already logs everything - the Console, the debug channel, the admin
chat all carry the same fan-out from announce.send_debug(). That is a log, and
a log is the wrong shape for "did anything go wrong while I was asleep":
everything is in it, so nothing stands out.

This is the other shape. A handful of call sites that KNOW they are one of
those events raise a notice alongside their log line, and the dashboard shows
a count of the ones nobody has acknowledged yet. Two severities, a read
marker, and a file on disk so a kick at three in the morning is still there at
nine.

Four seams, tested separately because they fail separately:

  * announce.record_notice/unread_notices/mark_notices_read - the store and
    the arithmetic of "how much of this is new".
  * db.load_notices/save_notices - what survives a restart, and what a
    hand-edited or truncated file costs.
  * announce.send_debug(notice=...) - the seam that makes raising one a
    property of the log line rather than a second call to forget.
  * webserver.build_notices_payload/mark_notices_read_result - what the page
    is handed, and who computes the badge.

The page's own structure - the badge element, the view registration, whether
`hidden` actually hides - is checked in tests/test_web_assets.py, where every
other structural check on the dashboard already lives.
