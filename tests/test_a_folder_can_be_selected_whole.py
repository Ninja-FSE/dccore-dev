"""A folder heading can select every file under it.

Asked for during the beta, looking at a nine-track album: an album is the unit
people actually want, and ticking nine boxes one at a time to get one is the
kind of work a page should be doing for them.

WHERE IT SITS. In the same column as the file checkboxes it commands, so the
relationship is visible rather than something to work out - which is why the
heading's cell is split into a check column and a colspan of four, instead of
spanning all five as it did.

THREE STATES, NOT TWO. Checked, unchecked, and INDETERMINATE for
some-but-not-all. The third is the honest one: a box reading "unchecked" while
four of nine rows are selected describes a selection that is not the one in
force.

A COLLAPSED FOLDER SELECTS TOO. Its rows are in the document already -
collapsing hides them rather than removing them - so a folder can be selected
without being opened, which is most of the point when a list has hundreds.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. It selects the rows that are RENDERED. A folder past
the page's row ceiling arrives cut short and says so in its own row, and a box
that silently claimed the rest would be claiming to have queued files nobody
has seen.

Nothing here executes JavaScript, so these read the source. Where that is a
weak way to ask a question, the assertion is on the STATEMENT that has to be
there rather than on a name that could be renamed around it.
