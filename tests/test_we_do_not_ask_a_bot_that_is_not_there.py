"""A bot that is not in the channel is not asked, and the page says which.

FROM THE BETA. A list was requested from a nick that was not on the network -
the operator's own WHOIS answered "No such nick" - and the fetch sat in the
queue holding a slot until it timed out, then reported "no response". Which
was true, and useless: nobody was there to respond, and that was knowable
before a line went out.

The daemon already knew. config.channel_users is synced from 353/JOIN/PART for
every channel it is in, and dcc.py has read it as proof of presence before
dispatching a send since long before this. A request is a PRIVMSG into a
channel: a nick that is not in one of ours cannot see it, so refusing is not a
guess about whether they would answer - it is the observation that they were
never asked.

AND THE SIDEBAR NOW SHOWS BOTH THINGS. The dot carried the list's freshness,
which left presence - the thing that decides whether asking is worth anything
- shown nowhere at all. A list can be perfectly current from a bot that signed
off an hour ago. So the dot is whether they are HERE, and the name's colour is
what we hold from them:

    dot     green   in a channel with us      name   green   list current
            red     not in one                       orange  theirs changed
            grey    still joining                    red     not downloaded
                                                     grey    cannot tell

NOTHING KNOWN IS NOT THE SAME AS NOBODY THERE. While the bot is still joining
the membership mirror is empty and every nick would read as gone - so that
state is its own, and it never refuses a fetch.
