"""Six colour codes, chosen from menus instead of typed as control bytes.

The second half of the beta request that asked for "select colors/symbols from
drop down menu and show preview of the messages". The preview shipped first,
because a menu of sixteen colours is only worth having once you can see what
it does.

WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, and it was not only ergonomics. config holds the
DECODED bytes - a role of "\\x0313" is four characters, two of them the 0x03
control code - and the settings page was handed them raw. A browser text input
cannot display 0x03, so the field for that accent read `13`. The code was
there, invisible, and what the operator could see was not what was set:
retyping what they read would have put a literal "13" into every advert.

The same value went the other way too. Saving from the dashboard wrote the raw
control byte into settings.conf - a file people edit by hand, where a 0x03 is
invisible in an editor and is exactly what an editor strips on save.

SO THE VALUE NOW CROSSES AS THE ESCAPE TEXT settings.conf.sample has always
documented, in both directions, and encode_irc_escapes() is the half of the
round trip that was missing. decode_irc_escapes() has been there since #170's
follow-up; nothing turned it back.

WHAT THE MENUS WILL NOT DO. A value the two dropdowns cannot express - bold in
the middle of it, a code past fifteen, anything hand-written - keeps its text
box and says why. Rewriting an operator's own value into the nearest thing a
dropdown can say is the one behaviour a picker must never have.
