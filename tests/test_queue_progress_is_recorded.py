"""The Queue table's progress bar needs a total to measure bytes_sent
against.

dcc.py already kept config.active_transfers[n]["bytes_sent"] live, updated
per chunk as a send runs (see start_dcc_send()'s own send loop) - but
nothing ever recorded what it was a fraction OF. webserver.build_queue_payload()
can show "N bytes moved" but never "N% done" without the file's total size
sitting somewhere reachable.

Real end-to-end, the same way tests/test_dcc_resume_end_to_end.py proves the
resume byte offset: a real listening socket, dcc.start_dcc_send() running on
its own thread, and a real client dialling in and reading partway through -
proving the size lands on the row before any byte is sent, and bytes_sent
keeps moving against it while the transfer is still in flight.

WHY THIS IS ALLOWED TO SKIP. Same reason as test_dcc_resume_end_to_end.py: it
binds a listening socket and dials loopback, which a sandboxed runner may
permit neither. The probe is a real bind-and-connect on the same range this
file then uses, so a skip means the environment cannot host the test, not
that something merely looked wrong.
