"""#133's filter bar: one term against every list you hold, live as you type.

WHY THERE IS AN INDEX AT ALL

`list_fetch` re-parses a list fresh on every call - deliberately, since #76
removed unbounded retention - so searching every held list by re-reading them
is arithmetically out of reach rather than merely slow. #133 measured one
719k-file list at 2.0s and ten held lists at about 11s. No amount of
debouncing turns eleven seconds into typing.

WHY FTS5 AND NOT AN ORDINARY INDEXED TABLE

#133 proposed the latter and called it "milliseconds across millions of rows".
That is true of one of the two queries this feature needs and false of the
other, and the false half is the headline behaviour. Measured against
4,000,000 rows in ten lists - the sizes #133's own channel capture recorded:

    plain table, LIKE '%term%'   page  1-41ms     which-bots  1150-1400ms
    FTS5, per-bot LIMIT 1        page   1- 4ms    which-bots     2-  4ms

Paging is fast either way because LIMIT stops the scan early. "Which bots have
nothing", the question that greys the sidebar, must prove a negative for every
bot and has no such escape - unless it is asked per bot, where each stops at
its first hit.

WHAT IT COSTS

FTS5 tokenises where find_matching_entries() does substring, so a mid-word
fragment no longer matches. That is a real behavioural difference and it is
what buys the feature: substring matching over four million rows is the 1.4s
query above. @find over our own list is untouched.
