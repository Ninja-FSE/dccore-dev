"""A handful of CTCPs could take every DCC port for a minute.

WHAT WENT WRONG

handle_dcc_chat()'s passive branch spawns _listen_and_serve() immediately.
Every other limit on that path runs AFTER accept():

  * is_bad_ip() is consulted on the connecting address, which does not exist
    until somebody connects;
  * the single-_pending rule inside _serve() applies to a session that already
    exists;
  * and irc.py deliberately leaves DCC CHAT out of the set
    security.is_flooding() meters, so the CTCPs that start them are not
    rate-limited either.

Nothing bounded how many listeners could be OPEN at once. So a handful of
passive DCC CHAT offers took every port in DCC_PORT_START..DCC_PORT_END and
held them for LISTEN_TIMEOUT - the same range DCC SEND needs. The bot stops
being able to send files at all, and recovers only when the listeners time
out.

Found by the full-program audit.

THE FIX

One listener at a time, which is the same shape as the _pending rule one step
further on - "at most one connected-but-unauthenticated session" - applied to
the step before it. A refused offer costs the sender nothing but another CTCP
once the current one resolves, and a real operator makes one at a time.
