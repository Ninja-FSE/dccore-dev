"""A list with nothing to group is not drawn as one group.

Reported from the beta: "If a file list is a rar file list there are no
folders. When I click on a rar file list I see 1 folder that I have to expand.
That's not needed when there are no folders."

Quite right. A bot that publishes its albums as packs has one row per pack and
no directory structure to speak of, so the whole list arrived as a single
unnamed group and was drawn as one collapsed row reading "(no folder)" with
11,232 files behind it - a click to get past a grouping that groups nothing.

THE TEST IS THE LIST'S SHAPE, NOT ANYTHING ABOUT .rar. One group, and that
group unnamed, which is exactly what folderGroupsFrom() produces for a flat
list of any origin. A list that genuinely has ONE folder is not flat: it has a
name worth showing, and its heading says which folder the rows belong to.

WHAT MUST NOT BE LOST WITH THE HEADING. It carried the select-every-file-here
box, in the same column as the boxes it commands. A flat list has no heading,
so that box moves to the table header - which is where a table-wide select
belongs anyway - keeping the same class and the same data-folder-index, so the
handler that already exists needs no changes: every row in a flat list is in
group 0.

And the two controls that only make sense with folders go away while there are
none. Expand all and Collapse all over a table with nothing to expand are
worse than absent: they claim a structure the table does not have.
