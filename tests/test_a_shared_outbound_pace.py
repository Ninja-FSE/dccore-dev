"""One clock for every outbound send, not two that never met.

Reported live (#406): an operator was killed with Excess Flood shortly after
growing their bot to 14 channels. queue_mgr.py's queue_worker slept MSG_DELAY
after every send; announce.py's debug drain slept DEBUG_MSG_DELAY after every
send, on its own thread, unaware the first thread existed. The server only
ever sees the SUM of what both lanes send - on stock settings, up to 2.2
lines/second against a server that kills a client sustaining much more than
about 0.5 - and nothing an operator can see names that sum.

runtime.OutboundPacer replaces both independent timers with one shared clock:
whichever lane sends next, from either thread, reserves the clock for its own
interval before anyone else's next send. The combined rate can therefore
never exceed one interval's worth of traffic, however the two lanes
interleave.
