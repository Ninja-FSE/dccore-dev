"""The speed record: stored, read, advertised - and, until this change, never
written.

db.save_speed_record() has existed from the start and had tests of its own that
passed: it does write atomically to the right path. announce.py has read the
value into every channel advert since. Nothing ever sat between the two. The
only callers of the writer were the tests, so db.get_speed_record() returned 0
on every install and the advert published "Record: 0k/s" for the life of the
feature.

That is a gap no unit test could see, because every unit involved worked. It
needed something to ask whether the units were connected - which is the second
class in this file.

    """The class of bug this file exists for.

    db.py's writers were each correct and each tested. One of them was simply
    never reached from the running daemon, so the value it maintained stayed at
    its default forever while a reader published it.

    A function is "reachable" here if a module outside db.py and tests/ calls
    it, or if another db.py function that is itself reachable calls it - which
    is how save_advanced_stats() legitimately has no direct caller of its own:
    update_stats_on_complete() wraps it and dcc.py calls that.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, VERIFIED RATHER THAN ASSUMED

    Reachability stops at the first daemon module that mentions the name. It
    does not ask whether THAT function is itself called. So a writer whose only
    caller is dead code still reads as reachable.

    Checked both ways while writing this: against the state that shipped -
    nothing outside tests/ calling the writer at all - it fails, which is the
    bug it is for. Remove only dcc.py's call and it passes, because
    stats_mgr.update_speed_record() still names the writer. Catching that
    second case means a real call graph across the whole daemon, which is a
    bigger tool than this file should be; the unit tests above cover that the
    wrapper behaves, and this covers that the chain is not severed at the end.
