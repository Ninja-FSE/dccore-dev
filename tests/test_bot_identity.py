"""The bot says what it is: CTCP VERSION, and the list's own masthead.

Two surfaces, one constant. Before this there was no project URL anywhere in
the tree - no `github.com/...` in any .py or .md - so a list that reached a
stranger carried nothing saying what produced it, and a CTCP VERSION query got
silence.

Both of these answer PRIVATELY. The CTCP reply is a notice straight back to
whoever asked; the list header travels inside a file that somebody requested.
Neither puts a line in a channel, which is the distinction that ruled out a
`!version` command: the objection was never to the information, it was to
answering in public every time anyone asks.
