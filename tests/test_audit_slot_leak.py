"""A failure setting up the listener must not cost a DCC slot for ever.

The caller appends the transfer to config.active_transfers BEFORE calling
start_dcc_send() - all three dispatch sites in check_queue_and_send() do, and
so does the direct path. Only the finally: of one try inside start_dcc_send
removes it again.

settimeout() and listen() sat ABOVE that try. An OSError out of either -
EMFILE when the process has run out of file descriptors, or the kernel
refusing the backlog - killed the dispatch thread with the row still in the
list and the listener socket still open.

Nothing ever revisits such a row. It names a transfer that is not happening,
and no completion will fire to remove it, so it is one permanent slot out of
MAX_DCC_SLOTS, cumulative, until the daemon restarts. The conditions that make
listen() fail are exactly the ones where losing serving capacity hurts most.

WHY listen() DID NOT SIMPLY MOVE DOWN

The handshake is what tells the peer to connect, so a peer dialling before we
listen gets a refusal. listen() has to stay ahead of it, which is why the
whole block moved inside the try instead.
