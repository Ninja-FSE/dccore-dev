"""The freshness LED says WHAT it is comparing, not just its verdict.

From a maintainer: "redownloaded [a bot's] list, its yellow, but it does not
update to green."

The tooltip said only "Their list has changed since you downloaded it". That
is the verdict with the evidence removed, and three quite different situations
produce it:

  * the re-download never landed (refused, timed out, still in flight)
  * it landed and was rejected, so the list we hold is still the old one
  * it landed fine, and the bot advertised something newer again afterwards

From outside they look identical, and telling them apart meant reading the
daemon log. The payload has carried `advert_then` and `advert_now` since the
LED was built - the exact two values webserver._freshness() decides on - and
the LED was dropping them.

The first class here is the control: the backend really does move a row to
"current" once a re-fetch rewrites the stored snapshot. So a LED that stays
yellow is reporting something true, and the tooltip is where the answer has
to come from rather than a bug to go fix in the comparison.
