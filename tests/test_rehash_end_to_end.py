"""One real `!rehash`, executed in a booted process.

WHY THIS DID NOT EXIST

`_handle_rehash_request()` is roughly seven hundred lines that quiesce
transfers, `importlib.reload()` eight modules, merge runtime state back,
re-baseline the nick, restore the advert token, reattach debug sinks and sync
channels. Across 120-odd test files, nothing ran it. Every existing test
either stubs `commands._handle_rehash_request`, calls
`reload_modules_in_order(modules=('defaults',))` for one harmless module, or
reads the function's source as text. test_commands.py says why outright:
running the real reload "would risk the identical thing happening to test
state".

That is the correct call for a unit suite and the wrong place to leave it for
a release. This is not a rare admin command - `webserver.py` dispatches it on
EVERY dashboard settings save, and `adminchat.py` and `irc.py` are two more
entry points. The daemon's least-tested code path is the one an operator
triggers by ticking a checkbox, and three of the audit's confirmed findings
lived inside it.

HOW IT RUNS ANYWAY

In a subprocess, against a throwaway working directory. The objection is
entirely about reloading modules the test runner is itself holding - a
separate interpreter has no such problem. The child seeds the live state a
rehash exists to carry across, changes settings.conf underneath itself the way
a dashboard save does, runs the real thing, and reports what survived as JSON.

WHAT THE FIXTURE HAD TO LEARN

The first version assigned `config.dcc_queue = {...}` and the queue came back
empty - which reads as the rehash losing it. It is not: dcc_queue is a
runtime.py-bound container and runtime is not reloaded, which is precisely why
it survives. Rebinding it on `config` detaches that alias, and the reload
re-points config at the runtime object. defaults.py says so in as many words
- "Mutate them in place. Never rebind them" - so the fixture was breaking the
documented invariant, not finding a defect. It mutates now, as the daemon
does.
