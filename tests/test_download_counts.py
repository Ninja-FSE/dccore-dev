"""Counting what this bot has actually sent.

The Stats page's last empty table. Everything else on that page reads a number
the daemon already kept; this one is a new counter, so it is the only part with
its own failure modes:

  * two transfers finishing at once, each discarding the other's increment -
    the exact bug db.py's other counters were rewritten to close;
  * two different tracks with the same filename being credited to one row,
    which is #110's ambiguity wearing a different hat;
  * and a cosmetic counter taking a transfer down with it, which would trade
    something that matters for something that does not.
