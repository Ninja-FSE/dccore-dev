"""`.gitattributes` ships unchanged, and one of its lines is wrong there.

In THIS repository `docs/UPDATES.md` is the internal changelog and is
deliberately export-ignored. In the PUBLIC repository the same path **is the
changelog** - extraction step 3 renames `UPDATES-PUBLIC.md` onto it.

So the line

    docs/UPDATES.md    export-ignore

is correct here and actively wrong there: shipped unchanged, it tells any
`git archive` run in the public repository to drop its own changelog. Nobody
would notice until a release tarball came out without one (#449).

The fix is a step in the extraction checklist, which is exactly the kind of
manual step that gets dropped quietly - so this guards that the step is still
written down, and that the condition making it necessary still holds.
