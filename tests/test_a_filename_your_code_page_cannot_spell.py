"""A path DCCore cannot print must not be a path DCCore cannot list.

Reported from a live install, on a Greek Windows box:

    External update_list.py failed (Exit Code 1): Unknown script error
    ...
    File "C:\\Python314\\Lib\\encodings\\cp1253.py", line 23, in decode
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8d in position 563

TWO FAILURES, ONE CAUSE, AND THEY HID EACH OTHER.

The CHILD: update_list.py runs as its own process, so oserve.py's console guard
- which has protected the daemon since it was written - did nothing for it.
Every line it prints is a path off somebody's disk, and on a console whose code
page cannot represent a character in one of those paths, print() raises
UnicodeEncodeError and the scan dies where it stood. A music library with one
accented filename is enough, which is to say: most of them.

The PARENT: subprocess.run(..., text=True) with no encoding decodes the child
with the same locale code page. So the bytes that did escape killed
subprocess's own reader thread, and the run reported "Unknown script error" -
because the output that would have explained it is exactly what could not be
read.

The operator got a failure with no cause, for a library that was fine.

THE FIX IS THE ONE THAT ALREADY EXISTED, applied where it was missing.
platform_compat.install_console_encoding_guard() has been the answer since
oserve.py called it; update_list.py, configure.py and adminchat.py are entry
points too and never did. The class guard below is the part that keeps this
fixed: a new entry point that forgets is a failing test, not a bug report from
somebody's channel.

And the parents now decode utf-8 with errors="replace", so a child that does
not guard itself still cannot take the daemon's report away with it. rar is
not Python and cannot be guarded at all - there, this is the whole fix.
