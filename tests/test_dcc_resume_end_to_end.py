"""A resumed send puts the tail of the file on the wire, and nothing else.

tests/test_dcc_resume.py covers the protocol and the wiring. This runs the
whole thing: a real listening socket, a real client connecting to it, and a
byte-for-byte check of what arrived.

It is the test that would have caught an off-by-one in the seek, a seek
applied to the wrong handle, or an ACCEPT whose position and whose seek
disagreed - none of which a source-reading guard can see.

WHY THIS IS ALLOWED TO SKIP. It binds a listening socket and dials the
loopback address. A sandboxed or locked-down runner may permit neither, and
this suite's rule for an environment-dependent hazard is to PROBE it and skip
rather than assert it universally. The probe is a real bind and a real
connect on the same port range the test then uses, so a skip means the
environment genuinely cannot host the test rather than that some proxy for it
looked wrong.
