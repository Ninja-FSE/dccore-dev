"""A merge that was "resolved" must not leave its markers in a tracked file.

This project's changelogs take a new entry from nearly every pull request, so
two branches merged in turn conflict in `docs/UPDATES.md` and
`docs/UPDATES-PUBLIC.md` as a matter of course, and each one is resolved by
hand. Twice in one day that went wrong, and nothing noticed either time:

  * a merge resolved on one side left a bare separator line behind, with no
    start or end marker beside it, and it sat in the changelog until a
    review read the diff;
  * a resolution script that handled the two changelogs left the same
    markers in `docs/WINDOWS.md`, committed, with the whole suite green.

A marker is three lines a person can miss and a test never looks for. This
looks: every tracked text file, the changelogs included (they are where it
happens), for a line that is exactly a start marker, an end marker, or the
separator.

The separator alone is what the first case left, so it is checked alone. A
markdown underline of exactly that width is the only other thing that can be
that line, and none exists here; if one is ever wanted, make the heading text
longer or use a dash rule.
