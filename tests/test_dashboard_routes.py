"""Every dashboard route is requested at least once, by a real HTTP request.

WHAT WAS MISSING

The suite tests webserver.py's payload BUILDERS thoroughly - build_stats_payload,
build_search_payload, build_fetch_status_payload and the rest all have their own
cases. What nothing tested was the WIRING: the two lines of each route that
decide which builder runs, what arguments reach it, and whether the login gate
sits in front.

Profiling the suite showed nine of the twenty-three route handlers were never
entered by any test, including `/` itself and all three `/api/tools/*` - the
three that mutate state. A route wired to the wrong builder, or one that quietly
lost its login gate, would have passed every test in the file.

    /                                    index()
    /api/search                          api_search()
    /api/stats                           api_stats()
    /api/fetch/status                    api_fetch_status()
    /api/fetch/<request_id>/download     api_fetch_download()
    /api/search/broadcast/status         api_search_broadcast_status()
    /api/tools/update-list               api_tools_update_list()
    /api/tools/update-list/status        api_tools_update_list_status()
    /api/tools/verify-list               api_tools_verify_list()

HOW THEY ARE TESTED

Against the builder's own return value, not against a hardcoded shape: asserting
that `GET /api/stats` returns exactly what `build_stats_payload()` returns proves
the route calls the right function, and leaves what that function should CONTAIN
to the builder's own tests, where it already is. A route rewired to a different
builder fails here; a change to a payload's contents does not.

The state-mutating route is driven with its worker replaced, because
`/api/tools/update-list` starts a real subprocess that walks the music library.
