"""A partial download can be resumed.

REPORTED FROM A BETA, from mIRC: a transfer sat at "Requesting resume" and
never moved. Not a failure, not an error - a client keeping its side of a
bargain this bot had never been able to answer. DCC RESUME was not
implemented at all.

The exchange is three lines. We offer:

    DCC SEND <name> <ip> <port> <size>

a receiver holding a partial file answers with what it already has:

    DCC RESUME <name> <port> <position>

and the sender MUST answer before anything else happens:

    DCC ACCEPT <name> <port> <position>

Only then does the receiver connect. Without the ACCEPT it waits.

MATCHED BY PORT, NEVER BY FILENAME. The port is ours, unique per offer, and
unambiguous. The offered name has already been through a space-to-underscore
pass and announce.fit_irc_filename() may have SHORTENED it to fit the IRC
line - so the name we sent is not always the name we hold, and matching on it
would fail on exactly the long-titled files most likely to need resuming.

THE ORDERING IS THE RACE. The offset is stored before the ACCEPT goes out,
because a receiver connects only once it has seen the ACCEPT. Sending first
and storing after would leave a window in which a prompt client connects and
is sent the file from byte zero, appended onto what it already had.
