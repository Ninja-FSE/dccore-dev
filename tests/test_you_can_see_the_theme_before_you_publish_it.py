"""What the channel will see, on the page where the colours are chosen.

Asked for during the RC1 beta: "bot font settings shows become easier. select
colors/symbols from drop down menu and show preview of the messages". This is
the preview half.

WHAT IT REPLACED. The six CUSTOM_THEME_* settings hold raw mIRC colour codes,
typed into text boxes. Finding out what a change did meant saving it,
rehashing, and waiting for the next advert - up to ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL away, on a
bot other people are using. The channel was the preview.

TWO SAMPLES, AND THAT IS NOT A PRESENTATION CHOICE. Between them the advert and
the completion notice use all six roles, and neither uses all six alone: the
advert never touches `accent`. One sample would leave one setting looking as
though it did nothing, which is exactly the confusion a preview exists to end.

BUILT BY THE REAL BUILDERS. announce.build_advert_line() and
build_transfer_complete_line() were lifted out of the advert loop and the
notice for this, and both callers now go through them. A preview built from a
copy of those templates would drift the first time one changed, and would then
lie with a straight face.

AND IT NEVER TOUCHES CONFIG. The point is the colour typed and not yet saved,
so the pending values are passed down to theme.palette() as an override
mapping. A live daemon is serving a channel while somebody is choosing
colours; the preview must not write to what every other thread is reading.
