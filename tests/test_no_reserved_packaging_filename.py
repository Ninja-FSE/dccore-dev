"""Nothing at the repository root occupies a filename pip treats as packaging.

WHAT WENT WRONG

DCCore's guided first-run wizard was called setup.py. That is Python's reserved
packaging filename: `pip install .` and `pip install -e .` execute it as a
build script. On a public repository, a contributor who types the most obvious
command in the ecosystem would have had an interactive configuration wizard
start prompting them for a nickname and an IRC server, in the middle of what
they expected to be an install.

Renamed to configure.py, which also describes it better - the README says it is
safe to run again later, so "setup" as in first-run was never the whole story.

WHY NOT ADD A pyproject.toml INSTEAD

That would make `pip install .` do something rather than fail. But DCCore is not
a package: it is a daemon you clone and run in place, with no third-party
dependencies and no importable public API. Shipping packaging metadata would
advertise an installation path nobody maintains. `pip install .` failing with
"no pyproject.toml or setup.py" is the accurate answer.
