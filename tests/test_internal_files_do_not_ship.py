"""A file called internal has to actually be excluded from the export.

WHAT WENT WRONG

`docs/UPDATES.md` is the full internal changelog - 50KB, written against this
repository's own PR and issue numbers and branch names, none of which resolve
anywhere outside it. #207 created `docs/UPDATES-PUBLIC.md` as the version that
ships and said the internal one "stays internal-only".

Nothing made that true. `git archive` is how the public tree gets extracted,
and `export-ignore` is the only thing it honours - without a rule, a file is
internal by intention and public in fact. The internal changelog was in the
archive, and it still named a real channel.

The final pre-extraction identity sweep did not catch it, because it read the
code and the docs for identities rather than asking which files leave the
building at all.

WHY A TEST RATHER THAN JUST THE RULE

An export-ignore rule is one line in a file nobody opens, and it fails
silently: the archive simply contains a bit more than intended, and nothing
says so. This asks `git archive` itself.
