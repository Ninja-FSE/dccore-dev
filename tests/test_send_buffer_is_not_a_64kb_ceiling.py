"""The socket send buffer is not left at a 64 KB ceiling on Windows.

MEASURED IN A BETA, and it cost a factor of eight. Same friend, same machine,
same link:

    OmenServe : 30.4 MB/s
    DCCore    : 2.95 / 2.98 / 3.00 / 3.01 MB/s   (four files, different sizes)

Identical every time, because it was arithmetic rather than congestion. TCP
cannot have more bytes in flight than the send buffer holds, so throughput is
bounded by SO_SNDBUF / round-trip-time. The default buffer on that machine was
exactly 65,536 bytes.

Setting the packet size to 4 KB made it WORSE - 1.6 MB/s - and fitting both
measurements gives the whole picture:

    effective ceiling  : 3.19 MB/s
    fixed cost / block : 1.27 ms
    implied RTT        : 20.6 ms      64 KB / 20.6 ms = 3.19 MB/s

An entirely ordinary internet round trip. Raising DCC_SEND_BUFFER to 1 MB took
the same transfer to 23.9 and 24.7 MB/s.

WHY PER-PLATFORM RATHER THAN SIMPLY A NEW DEFAULT. The old behaviour was
"never set it unless asked", justified by SO_SNDBUF disabling the OS's own
auto-tuning. That is sound on Linux, where tcp_wmem grows the buffer to fit
the connection and pinning it would be a downgrade on exactly the long-haul
links that need it most. It does not hold on Windows, where "leave it alone"
means a fixed 64 KB. Neither platform's answer is the other's mistake, so the
default differs and an explicit setting still wins on both.
