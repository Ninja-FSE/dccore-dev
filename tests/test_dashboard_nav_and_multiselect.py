"""#133's first two slices: the nav, and selecting a run of files at once.

Nothing in this project executes JavaScript, so everything here reads the
source. That is weaker than a real test and is stated plainly rather than
dressed up - but the two failures these guard against are both ones a reader
cannot see and the suite could not previously catch.

THE NAV (#133)

Queue is folded into Stats - "everything the bot knows about itself, with the
queue table keeping its place in the lower half of the view" - and the order
is by how often a view is used rather than by how central its information
feels: Search, Downloads, List Browser, Tools, Stats, then the two admin
surfaces.

That change touched three lists at once (`views` in app.js, the nav buttons
and the view sections), and a half-applied rename would have been invisible
until somebody clicked. tests/test_web_assets.py now checks the three agree;
this file checks the rename itself landed.

SHIFT-CLICK (#133)

Ctrl needs no code: a checkbox already toggles one box on its own. Shift has
to be handled on CLICK rather than change, because the range is computed
against the state BEFORE the browser toggles the clicked box - and because
shift-clicking across rows also selects the text between them, which looks
broken.
