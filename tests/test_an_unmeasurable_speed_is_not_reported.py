"""A rate nobody should act on is not stated as a fact.

FROM THE BETA, on a list zip:

    Sent: "SamothDCCore-2026-09-07.zip" to CSEv2 [138.63MB/s]
    "this seems to high to be true"

It was. sendall() returns once the bytes are in the KERNEL, not once the peer
has them. For a file LARGER than the socket send buffer the two converge - the
kernel blocks once the buffer is full, so the send paces itself against the
network and the clock measures something real. For a file that fits INSIDE the
buffer they do not converge at all: the whole thing is handed over in one go
and the clock measures a memory copy.

CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN THIS RELEASE, and predicted by it. Raising the default
send buffer to 4 MB - which took a real transfer from 3.0 to 24.7 MB/s - also
widened the window of files this applies to from under 1 MB to under 4 MB.
That is most list archives and many single tracks. The change said so at the
time and pinned the guard on the speed RECORD; it did not pin the guard on
what gets SAID, and there was not one.

MIN_RECORD_SECONDS is the floor the record has always applied, for exactly
this reason. A number too unreliable to keep is too unreliable to say, so the
same judgement now decides both - and the line goes into the CHANNEL, where a
figure nobody should act on is worse published than absent.
