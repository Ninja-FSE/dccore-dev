"""INSTALL.md said configure.py asks "six questions"; it asks seven, two of
them with follow-ups, then makes two offers (audit L36, #700).

collect_answers() asks nickname, server, channels, admin nick, password,
music folder and dashboard yes/no - the dashboard with a LAN follow-up and
a Flask-install offer - and main() then offers to build the list and to
import OmenServe totals. INSTALL.md listed six and omitted the dashboard;
WINDOWS.md listed a different set; neither mentioned the two offers, so a
novice expecting six was surprised by "Import them now?" with nothing
explaining it. INSTALL.md carries the list now, in the order asked, and
WINDOWS.md points at it. The guard reads the prompts out of configure.py
in source order and requires the guide's numbered items to follow them.
