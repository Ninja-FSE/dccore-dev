    Removal is by IDENTITY, never by position. start_dcc_send's finally used to do
    config.dcc_queue[u_key].pop(0), which removes whatever is first at that instant rather
    than the entry actually sent. Two ways that lost files:

      * The direct-send fast path builds a synthetic next_file never inserted into the
        queue, so the row at position 0 on completion is by construction a DIFFERENT,
        unsent file. It was deleted anyway.
      * The queue can be appended to or promoted while a transfer runs.

    Identity removal fixes both and needs no special case: a synthetic entry is not in the
    list, so nothing is removed and the user's real queue is left intact.

    A failed attempt no longer consumes the row, but it must not retry forever, so the
    attempt count lives ON THE ROW as 'send_fails' and is capped at config.MAX_SEND_FAILS.
    Keeping it on the row rather than in a side dict means its lifetime is exactly the
    row's: it cannot leak, cannot collide between users or same-named files, and cannot be
    inherited by a later request for the same filename.

    Two kinds of row are deliberately NOT retryable, because retrying them can only fail:
      * a temporary archive that is GONE from disk - every retry would abort immediately
        on file_size == 0 and emit a misleading error. While the archive is still there
        a packed row is as retryable as a plain file (#657, audit M55): the cleanup used
        to delete the .rar first and this function then found it "consumed" - a circular
        reason, and a 3 GB album that took ten minutes to pack got exactly one 30-second
        accept window before the user had to !rar it again. The finally now settles the
        row BEFORE the cleanup and keeps the archive for a row it kept;
      * a legacy non-dict row, which has nowhere to store a counter.

# What "let the OS decide" is worth, per platform.
#
# MEASURED IN A BETA, and it cost a factor of eight. The same friend, the same
# machine, the same link: OmenServe 30.4 MB/s, DCCore 2.95 / 2.98 / 3.00 /
# 3.01 MB/s on four files of different sizes. Identical every time, because it
# was arithmetic rather than congestion.
#
# TCP cannot have more bytes in flight than the send buffer holds, so
# throughput is capped at SO_SNDBUF / round-trip-time. The default buffer on
# that machine was exactly 65,536 bytes. Setting the packet size to 4 KB made
# it WORSE (1.6 MB/s), and fitting both measurements gives the whole picture:
#
#     effective ceiling  : 3.19 MB/s
#     fixed cost / block : 1.27 ms
#     implied RTT        : 20.6 ms   <- 64 KB / 20.6 ms = 3.19 MB/s
#
# An ordinary internet round trip. Raising DCC_SEND_BUFFER to 1 MB took the
# same transfer to 23.9 and 24.7 MB/s.
#
# WHY THIS IS PER-PLATFORM AND NOT SIMPLY A NEW DEFAULT. The old behaviour was
# "never set it unless asked", justified by SO_SNDBUF disabling the OS's own
# auto-tuning. That reasoning is sound on Linux, where tcp_wmem grows the
# buffer to fit the connection and pinning it would be a downgrade on exactly
# the long-haul links that need it most. It does not hold on Windows, where
# what "leave it alone" gets you is a fixed 64 KB - so the honest default
# differs by platform, and neither one is the other's mistake.
#
# WHY 4 MB AND NOT THE 1 MB THAT FIXED THE REPORT. The measured link was
# 20.6 ms away, where 1 MB is already far more than enough - but the ceiling
# is a function of DISTANCE, and this bot serves a channel, not one friend:
#
#     RTT  20 ms   1MB ->  52.4 MB/s     4MB -> 209.7 MB/s
#     RTT 120 ms   1MB ->   8.7 MB/s     4MB ->  35.0 MB/s
#     RTT 200 ms   1MB ->   5.2 MB/s     4MB ->  21.0 MB/s
#     RTT 300 ms   1MB ->   3.5 MB/s     4MB ->  14.0 MB/s
#
# At 200 ms - an ordinary Australia-to-Europe hop - 1 MB lands back at the
# same few megabytes a second this whole change exists to escape. Fixing the
# nearby case and leaving the distant one is not a fix, it is a shorter list
# of people who are still capped.
#
# The cost is bounded and small: SO_SNDBUF is a CEILING the kernel may buffer,
# not an allocation, and it only fills when the network is slow enough to make
# it useful. MAX_DCC_SLOTS is 3 by default, so the worst case is a few tens of
# megabytes on a machine already moving files.

#

#     DCC RESUME <name> <port> <position>

#
#     DCC ACCEPT <name> <port> <position>
#
# Only then does the receiver connect. Without the ACCEPT it waits, which is
# exactly what was seen: not a failure, not an error, just a client keeping
# its side of a bargain the other side never answered.
#
# MATCHED BY PORT, NEVER BY FILENAME. The port is ours, unique per offer and
# unambiguous. The offered name has already been through a space-to-underscore
# pass, and announce.fit_irc_filename() may have SHORTENED it to fit the IRC
# line - so the name we sent is not always the name we hold, and matching on
# it would fail on exactly the long-titled files most likely to need resuming.
#
# The name in our ACCEPT is the one WE offered, read back from the handshake
# that actually went out, rather than the one echoed at us. It is what the
# receiver is matching against, and it means no text from the wire is ever
# interpolated back into an outbound line.

# the moment the kernel's send buffer accepts the bytes - 4 MB of them on
# Windows by default - which for most files is the whole file, instantly.
#
# Nothing here read those acknowledgements. "Complete" meant "written to the
# kernel", so the bot declared success at t~0, reported a speed measured
# against a memcpy ("Speed: n/a (<1s)"), counted the file, slept 1.5 seconds
# and CLOSED - with megabytes still queued behind a link doing 50 KB/s. The
# receiver was cut off at whatever the wire had managed and reported the
# transfer incomplete; the channel had already been told it was sent. Found
# by a second operator, reproduced with mIRC (#526). The operator's own
# workaround - DCC_SEND_BUFFER = 4096 - "worked" because a tiny buffer makes
# sendall() block on the actual wire, so the loop tracked delivery by
# accident. The bigger the buffer, the earlier the bot hung up.
