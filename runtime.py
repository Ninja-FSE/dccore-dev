# runtime.py - live in-memory state, deliberately kept out of config.py.
"""The containers the daemon mutates while it runs.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS

`!rehash` calls importlib.reload() on config.py, which re-executes the module
body - and every `dcc_queue = {}` in it therefore rebinds to a brand new empty
container. Anything the daemon had accumulated was thrown away by the reload
itself.

commands.py grew a rescue for that: read the containers out before the reload,
write them back after. It works, but it is a list of names that has to be kept
in step with config.py by hand, and it fell out of step exactly once already -
the cross-bot fetch feature added two containers without touching the list, so
a !rehash silently emptied every fetched bot list and reported zero active
fetches while transfers were still moving bytes.

This module is never reloaded (see commands.py's modules_to_reload). Its
containers therefore survive a reload for a structural reason rather than
because somebody remembered to add them to a list, and a container added here
in future is safe without anyone doing anything.

HOW config.py STILL SEES THEM

config.py binds the same objects:

    import runtime
    dcc_queue = runtime.dcc_queue      # the same dict, not a copy

so every existing `config.dcc_queue[user]` keeps working untouched - there are
several hundred such references and none of them had to change. After a reload
config.py re-runs those bindings and picks the same live objects back up.

THE ONE RULE

    Mutate these in place. Never rebind them.

    config.dcc_queue.clear()          # correct
    config.dcc_queue.update(rows)     # correct
    config.dcc_queue = {}             # WRONG - silently detaches config's name
                                      # from the object runtime.py still holds,
                                      # and the two drift apart from then on

That is an easy mistake: the rehash restore path made it twice before this
change. tests/test_runtime_state.py parses the source and fails on any
rebinding of a name defined here, so it cannot be made silently.

WHAT IS NOT HERE

Scalars. `search_inprogress` and `rar_inprogress` stay in config.py, because
the binding trick above only works for mutable objects - rebinding a bool in
config.py could never write through to this module, so moving them would
change nothing except to make it look as though it had. Their behaviour across
a rehash is unchanged.
