# runtime.py - live in-memory state, deliberately kept out of config.py.
"""The containers the daemon mutates while it runs.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS

`!rehash` calls importlib.reload() on config.py, which re-executes the module
body - and every `dcc_queue = {}` in it therefore rebinds to a brand new empty
container. Anything the daemon had accumulated was thrown away by the reload
itself.

commands.py grew a rescue for that: read the containers out before the reload,
write them back after. It works, but it is a list of names that has to be kept
in step with config.py by hand, and it fell out of step exactly once already -
the cross-bot fetch feature added two containers without touching the list, so
a !rehash silently emptied every fetched bot list and reported zero active
fetches while transfers were still moving bytes.

This module is never reloaded (see commands.py's CORE_MODULES). Its
containers therefore survive a reload for a structural reason rather than
because somebody remembered to add them to a list, and a container added here
in future is safe without anyone doing anything.

HOW config.py STILL SEES THEM

config.py binds the same objects:

    import runtime
    dcc_queue = runtime.dcc_queue      # the same dict, not a copy

so every existing `config.dcc_queue[user]` keeps working untouched - there are
several hundred such references and none of them had to change. After a reload
config.py re-runs those bindings and picks the same live objects back up.

THE ONE RULE

    Mutate these in place. Never rebind them.

    config.dcc_queue.clear()          # correct
    config.dcc_queue.update(rows)     # correct
    config.dcc_queue = {}             # WRONG - silently detaches config's name
                                      # from the object runtime.py still holds,
                                      # and the two drift apart from then on

That is an easy mistake: the rehash restore path made it twice before this
change. tests/test_runtime_state.py parses the source and fails on any
rebinding of a name defined here, so it cannot be made silently.

WHAT IS NOT HERE

Scalars. `search_inprogress` and `rar_inprogress` stay in config.py, because
the binding trick above only works for mutable objects - rebinding a bool in
config.py could never write through to this module, so moving them would
change nothing except to make it look as though it had. Their behaviour across
a rehash is unchanged.

# own. A reload of that module re-runs the binding statement and picks the

# The reload window, which is not only about rebinding.

# importlib.reload(defaults) re-executes defaults.py from the top, and that

# with `settings_file.apply_to(globals())` only at the very END. So for the
# whole of a reload every setting an operator configured is transiently back
# to its shipped default - not corrupted, just not applied yet.
#
# Measured on a real install's file: a reader looping on config.NICKNAME
# during !rehash saw it blank for 52% of the reload. That is not a narrow
# race to reason away; it is half the window.
#
# Found from the dashboard. An operator saved DEBUG_CHANNEL, the browser
# re-fetched /api/settings the instant the response said "Rehash started",
# and the Settings page came back with Nickname, Admin nick(s) and Channels
# EMPTY. Nothing was lost - settings.conf was intact the whole time and a
# refresh showed the real values - but the page an operator uses to check
# their configuration told them their configuration was gone.
#
# Only the three REQUIRED settings looked wrong, which is why it took a real
# install to notice: every other setting on that page has a shipped default
# that happens to match what most operators run (SERVER, WEBUI_HOST), so it
# renders identically whether or not settings.conf has been applied yet.
#
# RLock, not Lock: the rehash thread holds this across the reload and calls
# announce.send_debug() inside it, which fans out to the web console sink -
# webserver code, on the same thread, reaching for the same lock.
#
# Here rather than in commands.py for this module's founding reason: a lock
# allocated in a module that !rehash reloads is a NEW lock every rehash, and
# this one is held BY the rehash.

# handle_rehash_request() reloads modules AND then compares the channel list it

# one's reload puts config.CHANNEL back to its literal None for the ~1ms window
# described on config_reload_lock above, and if the FIRST one reads its "new"
# channel list inside that window it sees no channels at all - so every channel
# the bot is in falls into the PART branch. Measured by audit: the bot PARTed
# every channel including the debug channel, sent no JOIN and no NAMES, emptied
# channel_users, and logged "[REHASH SYNC] Channel sync completed successfully."
# dcc.py treats channel_users as proof a user is present, so every queue then
# freezes. Reproduced with nothing patched in 4 of 60 overlapping runs.
#
# Overlapping rehashes are easy to reach: irc.py spawns an unguarded thread per
# "!rehash", adminchat.py does the same from the console, and webserver.py
# fires one on EVERY Settings save and every password change.
#
# SERIALISED, not skipped. A second rehash is often the one that matters - a

# interval - queue_mgr.py asks for MSG_DELAY, announce.py's debug drain asks
# for whichever of MSG_DELAY and DEBUG_MSG_DELAY is larger, so debug can be
# throttled slower than ordinary traffic if an operator wants that, but never
# faster - and every reservation, from either lane, holds the SAME clock for
# that long before anyone else's next send. The combined rate can never
# exceed one interval's worth of traffic, however the two lanes interleave.
#
# FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED (#655, audit M53). This used to be sleep-and-retry
# with no queue: every waiter slept until the same instant and whoever woke
# first took the slot. Four threads share the clock - queue_worker's VIP and
# standard lanes, the debug drain, the !ping and DCC ACCEPT direct waiters -
# so queue_worker's strict alternation bounded VIP to two of its OWN slots
# while the worker lost each of those to the drain by coin toss. Measured
# with the real threads: a drain backlog gave VIP about a quarter of the
# slots and gaps of ten to fourteen slots (a minute at MSG_DELAY=5) between
# consecutive VIP lines. Tickets, handed out in arrival order and served in
# that order, make every lane's wait bounded by the number of lanes ahead of
# it; a waiter that leaves without its slot (an exception) is stepped over
# rather than blocking the line.
