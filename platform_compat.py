# Console encoding

def install_console_encoding_guard(streams=None):
    """Stop a limited console code page from killing the daemon.

    The log strings in this project contain Swedish characters, and print()
    encodes with whatever code page the attached stream happens to use. That
    is fine on a Western European box, where cp1252 contains a-ring, a-umlaut
    and o-umlaut - and fatal anywhere else:

        cp1252  (Western European)   encodes them      no symptom
        cp1253  (Greek)              cannot            UnicodeEncodeError
        cp1251  (Cyrillic)           cannot            UnicodeEncodeError
        cp932   (Japanese)           cannot            UnicodeEncodeError
        ascii   (POSIX/C locale)     cannot            UnicodeEncodeError

    An uncaught UnicodeEncodeError from a print() kills whatever thread ran
    it. list.py prints on every completed search, so on a Greek-locale box the
    search thread dies the first time anyone searches.

    It only bites when the stream is NOT an interactive console: PEP 528 makes
    Python talk UTF-16 to a real console window regardless of code page, so a
    developer running the daemon in a terminal sees nothing wrong. Redirect
    that same command to a log file, or run it as a service, and every print()
    with a non-ASCII character becomes a crash. That is exactly how this
    daemon is meant to run.

    Three settings, because each closes a different gap:

      encoding="utf-8"      so a redirected log keeps the real characters
      errors="replace"      so ANY stream that still cannot encode something
                            degrades to "?" instead of raising
      line_buffering=True   so a line that has been printed is ON DISK

    That last one is not about encoding, but it belongs at the same moment and
    on the same streams. Python block-buffers stdout whenever it is not a
    console - a pipe, a log file, a service host - so print() output sits in a
    4-8KB buffer instead of reaching the file. Measured while deploying this
    daemon: 75 seconds of startup logging produced ONE line on disk, and
    force-killing the process lost every buffered line, including the JOIN and
    the channel advert. A probe that kills a child mid-run recovers 0 of ~24
    printed lines without this and 23 of 24 with it.

    The lines lost that way are the ones leading up to whatever killed the
    process, which are the only lines anyone actually needs. The cost is a
    flush per line, which is nothing against this daemon's log volume.

    The real fix for the ENCODING half is for the log strings to be English -
    that half only guarantees a character can never take the process down
    while the translation happens.

    Returns the list of stream names actually reconfigured, so startup can say
    so and the tests can assert on it.

    Prefixes lines, not writes. print() hands the stream its text and its

    folder listing - arrives as one write holding several lines. So the proxy
    tracks whether the last character it saw ended a line, and stamps the
    start of every line that begins on this stream, however the text was
    split up to reach it.

    Everything else - encoding, isatty(), fileno(), reconfigure(), flush() -
    is delegated to the real stream untouched, so code that inspects
    sys.stdout finds what it always found. In particular the encoding guard's
    reconfigure() lands on the real wrapper, and a later reconfigure() by
    anyone else does too.

    The format is read on every line rather than captured at install, so the
